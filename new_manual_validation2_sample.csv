RA and Menstruation Issues,comment,"thank you for reaching out and sharing.i didn’t mention it in my original post but i’ve had irregular period my whole life. when i was not on birth control i could go a year without a period. it sounds like we have a lot in common in that regard. i saw my obgyn, she ordered bloodwork and an ultrasound to get to the bottom of it. she suspects it’s early menopause but said that ra shouldn’t be impacting my reproductive system. but she did say that autoimmune disorders like to come in pairs. i am also on folic acid but that did not seem to make a difference on the days i took it vs. when i didn’t have it. i haven’t been as consistent with the folic acid, not intentionally missing it, just forgetting one day a week maybe. i hope you find some relief soon.",1,k5y74pp,,1697970316,1868,75,RA and Menstruation Issues,"thank you for reaching out and sharing.i didn’t mention it in my original post but i’ve had irregular period my whole life. when i was not on birth control i could go a year without a period. it sounds like we have a lot in common in that regard. i saw my obgyn, she ordered bloodwork and an ultrasound to get to the bottom of it. she suspects it’s early menopause but said that ra shouldn’t be impacting my reproductive system. but she did say that autoimmune disorders like to come in pairs. i am also on folic acid but that did not seem to make a difference on the days i took it vs. when i didn’t have it. i haven’t been as consistent with the folic acid, not intentionally missing it, just forgetting one day a week maybe. i hope you find some relief soon.","RA and Menstruation Issues [SEP] thank you for reaching out and sharing.i didn’t mention it in my original post but i’ve had irregular period my whole life. when i was not on birth control i could go a year without a period. it sounds like we have a lot in common in that regard. i saw my obgyn, she ordered bloodwork and an ultrasound to get to the bottom of it. she suspects it’s early menopause but said that ra shouldn’t be impacting my reproductive system. but she did say that autoimmune disorders like to come in pairs. i am also on folic acid but that did not seem to make a difference on the days i took it vs. when i didn’t have it. i haven’t been as consistent with the folic acid, not intentionally missing it, just forgetting one day a week maybe. i hope you find some relief soon.",2,1,1

Methotrexate for RA,comment,"i've taken methotrexate since childhood, i'm actually going to right now, and for me the side effects have been difficult. i always felt really nauseated after taking it, i've tried both injections and pills several times, but it didn't help much until recently i got some tips which maybe you can ask your doctor about if it might help you too, though don't do anything before speaking to them of course.

1. rather than taking the full dose from the get go as i've been trying prior, my doctor suggested that i start with three pills at first for a couple of weeks to get my body used to the medicine before adding one more until i reached the full dosage prescribed by the doctor.

2. i now take folic acid everyday to help with minimizing the nausea potentially caused by the medicine rather than just a day after taking methrotrexat.

this has worked for me to a big degree and so a lot of times i don't even feel any nausea anymore aside from some occasions where it does come back but it's way different than how it used to be so i'm just really grateful for that. it's also highly individual as my grandfather takes methrotrexat as well and he doesn't have any side effects whatsoever after taking folic acid.

"newly diagnosed, med questions",comment,"i'm also relatively young and on meloxicam. it's one of the only anti inflammatories that don't give me unmanageable side effects. on it's own, it doesn't help a lot but that would also depend on your dosage. methotrexate is one of the faster working ra meds and you can expect results within a month, give or take. others can take up to 4 months to start working. the side effects aren't great but if you time it right, they're manageable. give yourself a day or two to rest off the effects of each dose at first until you're more familiar with it. there aren't any ra meds that don't have side-effects, unfortunately, and mtx's can be managed with folic acid.

it's a lot. and i hate to be that person, but it will become routine. you'll get used to blood work, doctors, therapies, and even the pain will just become another thing you deal with. not happily, but it’s part of your life now.

and it's okay to be absolutely pissed off about it. i'm almost 14 years in, and i still get pissed off about it every now and then. if you have the wherewithal, get some help with that anger. i've been in therapy for a while, and while it doesn't do much for the physical crap, it does help me to find coping strategies that aren't just raging and lashing out at everyone around me. they didn’t sign up for this either, and taking it out on my people isn't fair to them.

Biologic fears,comment,"ok here is my experience as i have been on several of these meds:

remicade (infusions): if you can handle blood work you can do infusions. once a month at  a hospital for several hours is annoying but it’s a miracle in a bag and i definitely felt the difference walking in vs walking out. the whole time you are in a place that can immediately attend to your needs if there was to be a medical emergency, which is very rare. i think even with anxiety and thinking about the worst case scenario, it’s hard to not take solace in the fact that you are in exactly the right place of an emergency we’re to occur. a whole team of trained professionals at a moments notice. and once you’re all out there is practically no risk of anything drastic occurring. 

i was on remicade for several years and the worst thing that happened was sometimes the iv would be itchy, i tell the nurse, she slows the infusion down, itching goes away. also liked that the nurses could do blood work and iv in one poke! 

embrel: self injections created a lot of anxiety for me. these days i think they improved the formula so it doesn’t sting as much anymore. when i was on them it stung so bad and i had to hold it for at least 10 seconds on my leg. awful. i kept skipping dieses and after a panic attack i told my rheumatologist i can’t do this anymore. medication did work though, but bad fit for me. 

xeljanz: it is a newer medication and the long term effects aren’t as well known as the other medications. i have been on it for 7 years and love it, but i get the risks and that not everyone is comfortable with them. the once a day pill medications are the least hassle with the same potency as the other medications. 

side effect lists for medications: most side effects are not likely, in studies any time the participants have anything that could be side effect it has to be reported. so most lists are long and scary but the majority of the side effects are likely not caused by the medication itself. for many medications there are probably 2-3 key risks that are actually worthy of concern, and a doctor can help walk you through those risks in relation to your medical history. but if they want you to take a medication they are recommending it because they thing the risks outweigh the benefits, otherwise they wouldn’t make the recommendation at all.",8,jf38t3v,,1680722138,2629,122,Biologic fears,"ok here is my experience as i have been on several of these meds:

Worsening symptoms…permanent?,post,"
39f, diagnosed 8 years ago seronegative but only active symptoms in last 2-3 years. was on hydrochlorquine, methotrexate and now leflunomide. hydrochlorquine and methotrexate did nothing. leflunomide was a life saver. been on it for a year now. 

symptoms have begun worsening last few months. was running last summer and now damaged cartilage in my knee. 

the brain fog and my hands are my worrisome part. i work full time on a computer and i’m struggling. i can barely concentrate. my memory is shot.

my hands are constantly aching. they feel better in a fist vs stretched out. they are also trembling constantly. 

my next doctors appointment is september 5. if i go into biologics, will it relieve the stiffness? or is the stiffness here to stay?

i type all day long, hence my concern",2,12rv6k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/12rv6k3/worsening_symptomspermanent/,1681914662,5432,361,Worsening symptoms…permanent?,"

Overwhelmed with sideeffects of RA meds,comment,"i don’t have ra (previously misdiagnosed) but i haven’t tolerated my chemo (cyclophosphamide), hormone injection - prostap, immunosuppressants and steroids all that well.
legit came out of the hospital after a 5 day stay and everything was clear it was all just my body not liking it.

i’d say write down you’re intolerances and how you react so you can keep track in case it gets progressively worse.

with the perspiration- i get really bad hot flashes so i always have ice water in a thermal cup and invested in a fan for my bedroom and a handheld fan for when i go out.

the diarrhoea if you can check what exact medication sets you of that way if you can you can take it at a certain time so it doesn’t affect your day too much or see if there’s any food/drink that sets it off badly.
