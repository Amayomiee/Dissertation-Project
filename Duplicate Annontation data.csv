"Fairly Quiet RA, but Iritis Flares",comment,"i have had a few iritis (acute anterior uveitis) flare ups with my juvenile arthritis. nothing for a few years now fortunately as i have a better medication regime (humira, leflunomide, naproxen). i also have extremely dry eye but thatâ€™s probably unrelated (i think lol). 

when i was dealing with these flare ups and changing meds, my rheumatologist made a point to try meds that would help the eyes. i went on methotrexate which really helped (flare up of iritis basically stopped after that) and later switched to humira bc of methotrexate side effects. 

plaquenil can negatively affect the eyes and doesnâ€™t really help iritis specifically. speaking from juvenile arthritis experience (which is similar to ra, a little bit different pathology and less med options but the common ones are the same) - methotrexate is the first line of treatment for the eyes. humira (biologic) is also particularly good among the different types of biologics for treating iritis. also remicade (biologic only available as an infusion) is good. for kids, this would be the order to treat in (try methotrexate, then humira, then remicade), but most (60-82%) see improvement with methotrexate. 

overall, your rheumatologist should be the one treating your iritis (at least the root cause, your arthritis). the eye doctor canâ€™t do too much besides reactive treatment, aka treat it with steroids when it flares up. methotrexate is a logical and typical next step suggested by your dr to treat the arthritis-associated iritis.

[SEP] I really dislike having to depend on painkillers just to get out of bed each day, and often, I still can't. After 14 years of enduring this, I'm fed up. I wish to find a doctor who genuinely shows concern. I once consulted a rheumatologist and expressed my preference for trying tablets before resorting to injections. However, he insisted on Enbrel injections and disregarded my input. Moreover, he stopped refilling my prescription because I didn't get the COVID vaccine, and rather than changing my medication, he simply canceled my appointment the day before.",-2

Initially, I was severely anemic (did anyone else have anemia first?) and in a lot of pain, which I attributed to the anemia. After receiving iron infusions for anemia (RA wasn't diagnosed yet), my hot flashes got extreme. I asked my doctor for a year to let me start hormone replacement therapy (HRT), especially as I needed to travel for work. HRT was effective for me, and my hot flashes were under control until I recently began taking methotrexate. Now, 7 weeks into methotrexate, the hot flashes disrupt my sleep. Does anyone else have hot flashes with methotrexate? What solutions did you find? Methotrexate is effective for me with no side effects other than hot flashes.

These occipital neuralgia headaches are so debilitating,post,"just got diagnosed with ra feb 23rd after two years of pain with no answer, so i am actually very happy about getting an answer and starting medication. i started hydroxychloroquine feb 23rd and itâ€™s going to take a few months to kick in. 

my joint pain is definitely uncomfortable, limits my daily activities, and makes me very fatigued. but i can deal with all of this for a few more months while the medicine kicks in. 

the most debilitating symptom that i cannot deal with is the chronic neck pain and tension that has led to occipital neuralgia (compression of the occipital nerves at the base of the skull). these headaches leave me sweating, shaking, nauseous/puking, dizzy, crying, and unable to leave my bed all day. they only go away with excedrin extra strength which doesnâ€™t even work sometimes. they donâ€™t happen daily but i never know if iâ€™ll wake up with one 

i saw a neurologist as a recommendation by my rheumatologist before diagnosing me with ra. neurologist said the headaches are from super tight neck muscles and compression of the nerves. she gave me numbing injections and i also had just started meloxicam so the headaches went away temporarily

iâ€™m no longer on meloxicam, i was on it from jan 23 to feb 23. i finished a week long pack of  prednisone  about a week ago (because i was having the headaches) and now the headaches are back. i had one today and iâ€™m scared of when the next one will come.

"newly diagnosed, med questions",comment,"hello! i was diagnosed at 19 and was put on prednisone (5mg daily), methotrexate (20mg weekly) and hydroxychloroquine. methotrexate changed my life - i went from being in pain every day to eventually only having flares maybe once a fortnight. and then i cut out gluten and only had flares when i fucked up and ate bread (lol). i stayed on a low dose of prednisone for a while with the intention of going off it once the methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine kicked in. but i ended up having to stay on a low dose (2.5mg) for about 7 years because it was hard to wean off without pain. i never had any severe methotrexate side effects at all. a little fatigue, some nausea in the 24hrs after taking it so now i take it in the evening so i can sleep most of it off. but nothing severe at all. itâ€™s been a game changer for me in combination with he other meds. i feel a bit silly because when i was diagnosed i was so desperate to have relief i didnâ€™t read any information about any side effects, oops. but it ended up working out for me ðŸ˜‚

also as far as iâ€™m aware meloxicam is just an anti inflammatory (nsaid) not an immunosuppressant medication. therefore isnâ€™t likely do actually do much but mask a little bit of the pain. you need to be on immunosuppressive medication to halt the progression of the disease and prevent joint deformation in the future.

1. no i have not been able to have a single session since my diagnosis without a massive flare after. however maybe your disease progression is different! i also deal with hypermobility (eds) so this definitely adds to my pain levels.

i am currently on hydroxychloroquine twice daily. it helps but i have flare ups alot and the fatigue is a killer. i also have emotionally unstable personality disorder and complex ptsd. 

my body and mind works against me everyday. i work and raise two children. i have tried dmards but i am now running out of options as you all know all these meds carry a risk. 

i do not have any joint deformity and low levels of swelling my crp and esr are basically normal now. 

however flaring everyday,every thing is a struggle.

Feeling guilty,comment,"i understand where youâ€™re coming from. i was diagnosed at 18 and was on mtx for the first year or so, but it wasnâ€™t viable for me because it made me feel really nauseous and i have emetophobia so i started becoming really anxious every time i had to take it and eventually i stopped taking it without consulting my doctor (donâ€™t do that) which unfortunately lead to two of my fingers being deformed. during that time when i was struggling with mtx i remember reading an article in a magazine about an 8 year old boy who was also being treated with mtx for his jia, and his mum was talking about how he was basically being sick every weekend so that he could go through the week, and it made me feel guilty because i couldnâ€™t cope with what a kid was going through (now as an adult iâ€™m more like â€œjesus christ no one should have to live their life like thatâ€). after mtx i was being treated at the hospital once a month for about 6 months, and then i wanted to go study abroad so i asked my doctor if that was even an option for me and she prescribed me simponi which is a bio medication. when i first learned how expensive it was i was in shock, but thankfully living in europe, i have only ever had to pay a fraction of the cost. iâ€™ve been on it for over 10 years now, and iâ€™ve studied abroad in the uk and in the us and now i live in the uk, and iâ€™m now getting it completely free on the nhs. the only criteria they have here is that you have tried 2 other treatments before.

Possible RA,comment,"pregnancy can mess with your body. basically any drastic physical change or traumatic event can trigger an autoimmune disease to flare/awaken. you had your specific ana panel run i assume. did anything else show a positive factor? what was your ana? crp? there are other determining factors and i worry that not enough tests are being done for you.

Overwhelmed,comment,"seems like most people are making the suggestions i would.

iâ€™ve been having a lot of difficulty with anxiety and depression myself. iâ€™ve been working with therapists and have found some good medication, and iâ€™ve improved a great deal. i have to say i owe some of it to the new medication i started about a month ago. iâ€™m on orencia after having only mild success with other non-biologic drugs. i think iâ€™ve found the right combo of anti-anxiety drugs, ra drugs, and therapy that i finally feel closer to normal than i have in ages.

iâ€™d also think about removing prednisone from your lineup if that hasnâ€™t already been discussed. one of the potential side effects is mood swings, and iâ€™ve known several people that canâ€™t take it because they become unreasonably angry at the drop of a hat. it doesnâ€™t sound like the drug has been particularly effective for you either.

lastly, if youâ€™re able to do so, iâ€™d recommend acupuncture and gentle massage. i canâ€™t do it all the time, but it helps greatly when i can. i have to ensure the massage therapist either had knowledge of how to work on those with ra or give them very specific guidelines - no intense pressure (so a 2 on the scale), turn the bed warmer down so i donâ€™t feel like a fried chicken, stay away from massaging the actual joints, etc.

lastly, if youâ€™re able to do so, iâ€™d recommend acupuncture and gentle massage. i canâ€™t do it all the time, but it helps greatly when i can. i have to ensure the massage therapist either had knowledge of how to work on those with ra or give them very specific guidelines - no intense pressure (so a 2 on the scale), turn the bed warmer down so i donâ€™t feel like a fried chicken, stay away from massaging the actual joints, etc.

good luck and let us know how your journey is going!",2

Tips for Humira?,comment,my tip is to take it out of the fridge well in advance of injecting. i think the instructions say 30 minutes or so but i found that it would still sting more than it needed to if i only did 30 minutes. i would generally leave it out for several hours (e.g. take it out when i get home from work and inject right before bed),5,ivw01kt,,1668127274,1568,56,Tips for Humira?,my tip is to take it out of the fridge well in advance of injecting. i think the instructions say 30 minutes or so but i found that it would still sting more than it needed to if i only did 30 minutes. i would generally leave it out for several hours (e.g. take it out when i get home from work and inject right before bed),Tips for Humira?

Methotrexate and alcohol,post,"hi ra friends, i wanted to get other people's experiences regarding methotrexate and alcohol use (or lack thereof). i am going to bump up to 15mg per week starting next week. i have never been a big drinker. i take care of myself, and eat well. however, the idea of never being able to have a celebratory drink with friends while on vacation, or a glass of wine on a first date or something is really depressing to me and putting me in a funk. i have a tropical vacation planned, and i'm just bummed about it. my rheumatologist told me that no amount of alcohol can be condoned, and if i do decide to have a sparing drink, to run labs when i get back. i'm just trying to think about if i want to risk it or not. i'm soliciting thoughts, perspectives, and commiseration! :) thank you!

Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"hi! i've been diagnosed since 31 (currently 38) tho i had symptoms since my early to mid 20s. 

rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive disease. it started out in my elbow and my thumb joint. it then spread. so now my hands, wrists, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet and oddly enough my jaw on both hinges have all flared at one time or another. my knee caps are also weak so when i stand up during a flare there is a good chance i could have my kneecap slip out of place too which is a whole additional level of excruciating pain. 

thankfully my dr who diagnosed me at 31 is a good man (not good bedside by any means) but has always  taken me for my word and has done what he can to make  sure i'm not in constant pain and adjusting/ changing meds as needed. 

i didn't have that much luck as a younger woman - most drs focused on my weight, my dietary habits or my stress levels. it was frustrating to not get help for something that kept occuring. i even had one dr say the arthritic nodules on my arms were calluses from me leaning against my desk while i typed at work..yeah... no they freaking weren't. they disappeared once i got on proper meds. 

i've been on 4 different meds including pain meds. i stopped taking the injection biologic at 35 when i became pregnant (some of the other ones you need to wean off first before - this one he said to just stop when you find out). i was lucky and my symptoms disappeared with pregnancy (it's not guaranteed but was a positive side effect! haha!)  i was able to conceive within two cycles so no delay in fertility for me from the meds! 

however pain symptoms hit me like a freight train come 4 weeks after birth. took my injection and it did nothing. i switched to a pill version and have been taking that pill version since 2020. i am generally pain free - tho weather changes do create flares in my shoulders and knees. over the counter pain meds for 12 hours usually does the trick!

i do have damage in my hands and knees - there's no changing that now - so i know as i get older there will be more issues. right now i'm working on just being as pain free as i can be to enjoy my life. i get blood work done every 6ish months and have been doing good at each of my check ins with him!",5,j2ag30j,,1672432398,4035,242,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"hi! i've been diagnosed since 31 (currently 38) tho i had symptoms since my early to mid 20s.

i've been on 4 different meds including pain meds. i stopped taking the injection biologic at 35 when i became pregnant (some of the other ones you need to wean off first before - this one he said to just stop when you find out). i was lucky and my symptoms disappeared with pregnancy (it's not guaranteed but was a positive side effect! haha!)  i was able to conceive within two cycles so no delay in fertility for me from the meds! 

however pain symptoms hit me like a freight train come 4 weeks after birth. took my injection and it did nothing. i switched to a pill version and have been taking that pill version since 2020. i am generally pain free - tho weather changes do create flares in my shoulders and knees. over the counter pain meds for 12 hours usually does the trick!

i do have damage in my hands and knees - there's no changing that now - so i know as i get older there will be more issues. right now i'm working on just being as pain free as i can be to enjoy my life. i get blood work done every 6ish months and have been doing good at each of my check ins with him!",0

Pretty Upset just want to vent!!,post,"about six months ago i started having bad flares in my hands wrists and knees. every morning it's a surprise to find out what hurts. or what digit is stuck in a curled position if it's going to be difficult to walk.

"Starting Arava (Leflunomide). Taking it by itself, is that normal?",comment,"there's no one silver bullet for the condition so it may mean trying a few things out to see what works for you. in my experience they'll say 12 weeks for something new (and then maybe give it longer if there's no immediate result. )  
i had about 8 months of guessing until i progressed to a biologic.   
prednisone to try to control the symptoms while we tried out methotrexate, then added hydroxychloroquine and then leflunomide.  
once there was demonstrated benefit from the adalimumab we were able to drop the prednisone, then the leflunomide, and most recently, reduce the methotrexate dosage with a view to discontinuing that too.   
the prednisone came with the most danger so i was under constant pressure from my rheumy to stop taking that, and then the leflunomide had the most likelihood of side effects so we were both happy to see the back of it. (i keep some prednisone on hand if i've had, or am planning on having, a really big day. )  
i'd say they want you to stay away from methotrexate (which is the most common treatment) because of your age because it ""is not recommended in pregnancy or while trying for a baby. this medicine can stay in a woman's body for 6 months after they stop taking it. for men, there is a risk that methotrexate can damage sperm. this can affect the way a baby develops during pregnancy."" (nhs). (constantly hear of doctors assuming potential pregnancy despite patient protestations 'just to be safe'.)  
definitely ask what their thinking is for peace of mind.   
for the record, i woke up to go for a wizz the first night after taking the biologic and found i could walk pain-free for the first time in 9 months. not a dream: just hit the right drug finally.   
i'd also recommend hitting up old posts (maybe searching for leflunomide as long as you don't get worked up about tiny chances of side effects) to see other newbies war stories as well as all the healthy lifestyle stuff (and placebos) that can help you cope.   
for my hands (and wrists) i did heat and cold in the mornings (hot shower, ice in the sink full of water, strap-on ice packs, pressure gloves. )

for my hands (and wrists) i did heat and cold in the mornings (hot shower, ice in the sink full of water, strap-on ice packs, pressure gloves. )  
unfortunately there's no normal but there's lots of resources here and plenty of support and hope.   
all the best.","Starting Arava (Leflunomide). Taking it by itself, is that normal? [SEP] there's no one silver bullet for the condition so it may mean trying a few things out to see what works for you. in my experience they'll say 12 weeks for something new (and then maybe give it longer if there's no immediate result. )  
i had about 8 months of guessing until i progressed to a biologic.   
prednisone to try to control the symptoms while we tried out methotrexate, then added hydroxychloroquine and then leflunomide.  
once there was demonstrated benefit from the adalimumab we were able to drop the prednisone, then the leflunomide, and most recently, reduce the methotrexate dosage with a view to discontinuing that too.   
the prednisone came with the most danger so i was under constant pressure from my rheumy to stop taking that, and then the leflunomide had the most likelihood of side effects so we were both happy to see the back of it. (i keep some prednisone on hand if i've had, or am planning on having, a really big day. )  
i'd say they want you to stay away from methotrexate (which is the most common treatment) because of your age because it ""is not recommended in pregnancy or while trying for a baby. this medicine can stay in a woman's body for 6 months after they stop taking it. for men, there is a risk that methotrexate can damage sperm. this can affect the way a baby develops during pregnancy."" (nhs). (constantly hear of doctors assuming potential pregnancy despite patient protestations 'just to be safe'.)  
definitely ask what their thinking is for peace of mind.

Waiting on diagnosis and I am so overwhelmed and in so much pain.,post,"hi everyone. about a week and a half ago my right knee started swelling out of no where and at first there was no pain and about 3 days in it started to hurt excruciatingly. i canâ€™t walk, put any weight on it or even just relax my knee muscles. my knee is huge. 2 days ago i finally managed to see my orthopedic surgeon for a follow-up on 3 herniated discs iâ€™ve been suffering from the last 2 months which had me bed ridden and in excruciating pain. he also took a look at my knee and just kept saying â€œwow thatâ€™s so swollen â€œ he then stuck a needle in and extracted a little bit of yellow fluid all while saying wow there is so much and your swollen. then he injected me with some steroids and ordered me to go get an x-ray done and come back in a week to follow up. i asked him what he thought it might be and he said rheumatoid arthritis and basically walked out of the room. it was all in all a horrible visit and he couldnâ€™t have been bothered to explain anything just rushed me on through. which is whatever at this point. my knee is still super swollen and the pain is out of control, i am taking vicodin currently and meloxicam which work fine for a few hours. when is the steroid supposed to start working? what can i do in the meantime to help ease the pain and swelling? i am so overwhelmed and frustrated i canâ€™t stop crying. i know this isnâ€™t a â€œdeathâ€ sentence and can be managed long term after doing some research but right now i am just at the end of my rope and this all feel alike a nightmare, iâ€™ve been in so much pain everyday for the last 2 months between herniated discâ€™s, swollen painful ankles a few weeks ago iâ€™m just really struggling and am in a really dark place!

[SEP] Hi all. A week and a half ago, my right knee swelled unexpectedly. Initially painless, it became excruciating after three days. I can't walk or even relax my knee muscles. It's very swollen. Two days ago, I saw my orthopedic surgeon for a herniated disc follow-up, which caused bedridden agony for two months. He was surprised at my knee's swelling, extracted yellow fluid, and injected steroids, then ordered an X-ray and a follow-up in a week. He suggested it might be rheumatoid arthritis but didn't elaborate. The visit felt rushed and unhelpful. My knee remains swollen, and the pain is unbearable. I'm on Vicodin and Meloxicam, which provide brief relief. When will the steroid start working? I'm seeking any advice to ease the pain and swelling. This whole experience feels nightmarish. I've been in constant pain due to herniated discs and swollen ankles. It's a tough, dark time for me.",-2

If you need a little hopeâ€¦,comment,"ra is an autoimmune disease. it is triggered by your immune system reacting to foreign substances which cause you to make autoantibodies which attack your own tissues.
the responsible immune system involved is that of your gut tissue.

some people find that by keeping a careful log of everything they eat, drink, etc. each day and noting flare ups, good days, bad days, etc. you can often work out what that substance was. a journal is also useful to track meds and symptoms.

if you google, you will find that many people have found grains to be such an antigen, e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, etc. i am one of those.

a big clue that food is involved is that your ra symptoms always improve when you fast (e.g. you are ill and can't eat much). another is that your  symptoms change when on holiday and your diet has changed.


so 1. keep a diary, 2. try a grain free diet for 1 month.

with ra, everyone seems to be different. some people have shown fantastic improvement by avoiding certain foods, some improve on a certain med while to others that med makes them even worse.

only you know what affects you. your doctor can only advise but it is you who are going through the pain and suffering. you need to research what an autoimmune disease is, log your details and work out what substances may be affecting you.

as an example celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that can be successfully treated by simply avoiding certain glutens. most celiacs are sensitive to one particular gluten e.g. wheat gluten, rye gluten or barley gluten. but it has been found that about 20% react to a different substance (e.g. the gluten in oats). for those 20%, they have to work out what that substance is.

ra, celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases are all closely related, often symptoms overlap and doctors find it hard to distinguish between them because the spectrum of symptoms are so wide.
 
with my ra, if i avoid all grains then my symptoms improve dramatically but if i eat some gluten-free breads, i get a bad flare up the next morning. so i seem to be sensitive to something else in some breads , not just wheat.

i can eat rice (which is a grain and so does contain rice gluten) with no problems. i have not tested myself on other specific grains apart from wheat ( i made my own bread using only wheat flour with very bad results which was actually how i discovered all this stuff about grains and ra and that it was a 'thing'!).",2,ja22zdx,,1677394646,4142,254,If you need a little hopeâ€¦,"ra is an autoimmune disease. it is triggered by your immune system reacting to foreign substances which cause you to make autoantibodies which attack your own tissues.

Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,comment,"i also have a lot of trouble with steroids. it makes my bipolar go totally wonky but itâ€™s on the agitated hypomanic end. however, i talked to my psychiatrist and she has given me some extra seroquel if needed. i have no idea if that is your issue or whether it would help you but i am just mentioning it. also, i have gotten tramadol and opioids at the er. they can clearly see when iâ€™m in that amount of intense pain. unfortunately the tramadol didnâ€™t work for me but the opioids do. they give me like a 10 day script usually so itâ€™s just enough to give the other meds time to work. iâ€™m so sorry youâ€™re in so much pain and i really hope you can get some relief soon.

Biologic fears,comment,"ok here is my experience as i have been on several of these meds:

remicade (infusions): if you can handle blood work you can do infusions. once a month at  a hospital for several hours is annoying but itâ€™s a miracle in a bag and i definitely felt the difference walking in vs walking out. the whole time you are in a place that can immediately attend to your needs if there was to be a medical emergency, which is very rare. i think even with anxiety and thinking about the worst case scenario, itâ€™s hard to not take solace in the fact that you are in exactly the right place of an emergency weâ€™re to occur. a whole team of trained professionals at a moments notice. and once youâ€™re all out there is practically no risk of anything drastic occurring. 

i was on remicade for several years and the worst thing that happened was sometimes the iv would be itchy, i tell the nurse, she slows the infusion down, itching goes away. also liked that the nurses could do blood work and iv in one poke!

Enbrel - infections & HPV ?,comment,"i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a really tough disease even when everything else is fine with your health.

i don't have the aversion to medication to the degree that you do, and i still had to really think about it when i was put on hydroxychloroquine. it worked fine for a bit but then my ra suddenly turned severe and aggressive. i went from having some relief to unable to do much of anything except shuffle when i wanted to walk and unable to hold on to most things, even a pen. i would have to use my other hand to pick up the pen and then place it in my right hand.

i was put on orcenia infusions 3 months ago and within a week of the first infusion, i started to feel better. it's now been 3 months and i feel so much better with very little pain and more flexibility.

all of this is to say that sometimes you can't know before you go. i was told that i will have a greater chance of infections so i increased my supplements such as vitamin c, to do everything i can to help my immune system since the infusions are aggressively affecting the cells that are attacking the joints.

no one here can or should give you any type of medical advice but what we can do is tell you what we have experienced. i'm very happy with the results and i take it one day at a time. i also heard that treatment can work for a while and then not, so there's no way to know.",2,k1m9deh,,1695329037,5394,355,Enbrel - infections & HPV ?,"i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a really tough disease even when everything else is fine with your health.

Could this be RA?,post,"hi all, 

i'm at a loss with my symptoms and hoping for some insight.

i was diagnosed with uveitis in january and have had 2 episodes to date. i have also had recurrent scleritis in my left eye since march-ish, pretty much ongoing with intermittent improvement with prednisone (on my third taper). chronic dry eyes. for about a month when i first got really sick i could not cry or make tears out of my left eye at all.

i've had random swollen joints, mostly knees and hands but have had ankles and feet as well. i wake up with crazy stiffness every morning that lasts about 1.5 hours. i have muscle pain as well. i also have raynaud's and livedo reticularis. 

i've had sores in my mouth pop up when other symptoms flare. i have geographic tongue diagnosed by an oral pathologist. my right ear feels full and plugged and causes hearing loss whenever i go off prednisone. 

some low grade fevers. exhaustion, weakness dizziness, tachycardia, high bp, nausea, and constipation symptoms all flare up when off prednisone. i've had hair loss. i have had had weird blood pooling in my feet and facial flushing.

my bloodwork shows next to nothing. i have a low positive ana (1:80 speckled) and have had high esr and crp during flares. i've also had high platelets, low wbc, and rbc in my urine. mild anemia but no iron deficiency. negative rf. negative ena panel. my rheum is testing anti-ccp and anca next. 

he initially thought i had sjogrens and put me on hydroxychloroquine 4 months ago. i had a lip biopsy which was negative so he took me off the hcq 3 days ago because he said ""it won't do anything"" because he doesn't think i have a connective tissue disorder. 

i'm at a loss. my ophthalmologist says she can't do anything more for the scleritis because it has to be managed with systemic treatment which my rheum needs to deal with. i'm only on 10mg of prednisone and tapering for the next 8 weeks, and now no hcq. i said i thought i had been helping with the livedo reticularis and dry eyes but he doesn't care and doesn't listen to me. 

does this look like it could be ra? by my own googling it seems like the ccp test is to rule out ra which he obviously doesn't think i have if he took me off the hcq. i feel like if those tests are negative he will just send me back to my family doctor. i'm just devastated. i started crying in his office because i have been sick for 9 months and he dismisses essentially all of my symptoms.
