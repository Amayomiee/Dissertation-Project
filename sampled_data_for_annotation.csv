"Fairly Quiet RA, but Iritis Flares",comment,"i have had a few iritis (acute anterior uveitis) flare ups with my juvenile arthritis. nothing for a few years now fortunately as i have a better medication regime (humira, leflunomide, naproxen). i also have extremely dry eye but that‚Äôs probably unrelated (i think lol). 

when i was dealing with these flare ups and changing meds, my rheumatologist made a point to try meds that would help the eyes. i went on methotrexate which really helped (flare up of iritis basically stopped after that) and later switched to humira bc of methotrexate side effects. 

plaquenil can negatively affect the eyes and doesn‚Äôt really help iritis specifically. speaking from juvenile arthritis experience (which is similar to ra, a little bit different pathology and less med options but the common ones are the same) - methotrexate is the first line of treatment for the eyes. humira (biologic) is also particularly good among the different types of biologics for treating iritis. also remicade (biologic only available as an infusion) is good. for kids, this would be the order to treat in (try methotrexate, then humira, then remicade), but most (60-82%) see improvement with methotrexate. 

overall, your rheumatologist should be the one treating your iritis (at least the root cause, your arthritis). the eye doctor can‚Äôt do too much besides reactive treatment, aka treat it with steroids when it flares up. methotrexate is a logical and typical next step suggested by your dr to treat the arthritis-associated iritis.

These occipital neuralgia headaches are so debilitating,post,"just got diagnosed with ra feb 23rd after two years of pain with no answer, so i am actually very happy about getting an answer and starting medication. i started hydroxychloroquine feb 23rd and it‚Äôs going to take a few months to kick in. 

my joint pain is definitely uncomfortable, limits my daily activities, and makes me very fatigued. but i can deal with all of this for a few more months while the medicine kicks in. 

the most debilitating symptom that i cannot deal with is the chronic neck pain and tension that has led to occipital neuralgia (compression of the occipital nerves at the base of the skull). these headaches leave me sweating, shaking, nauseous/puking, dizzy, crying, and unable to leave my bed all day. they only go away with excedrin extra strength which doesn‚Äôt even work sometimes. they don‚Äôt happen daily but i never know if i‚Äôll wake up with one 

i saw a neurologist as a recommendation by my rheumatologist before diagnosing me with ra. neurologist said the headaches are from super tight neck muscles and compression of the nerves. she gave me numbing injections and i also had just started meloxicam so the headaches went away temporarily

i‚Äôm no longer on meloxicam, i was on it from jan 23 to feb 23. i finished a week long pack of  prednisone  about a week ago (because i was having the headaches) and now the headaches are back. i had one today and i‚Äôm scared of when the next one will come.

1. no i have not been able to have a single session since my diagnosis without a massive flare after. however maybe your disease progression is different! i also deal with hypermobility (eds) so this definitely adds to my pain levels.

Overwhelmed,comment,"seems like most people are making the suggestions i would.

i‚Äôve been having a lot of difficulty with anxiety and depression myself. i‚Äôve been working with therapists and have found some good medication, and i‚Äôve improved a great deal. i have to say i owe some of it to the new medication i started about a month ago. i‚Äôm on orencia after having only mild success with other non-biologic drugs. i think i‚Äôve found the right combo of anti-anxiety drugs, ra drugs, and therapy that i finally feel closer to normal than i have in ages.

i‚Äôd also think about removing prednisone from your lineup if that hasn‚Äôt already been discussed. one of the potential side effects is mood swings, and i‚Äôve known several people that can‚Äôt take it because they become unreasonably angry at the drop of a hat. it doesn‚Äôt sound like the drug has been particularly effective for you either.

lastly, if you‚Äôre able to do so, i‚Äôd recommend acupuncture and gentle massage. i can‚Äôt do it all the time, but it helps greatly when i can. i have to ensure the massage therapist either had knowledge of how to work on those with ra or give them very specific guidelines - no intense pressure (so a 2 on the scale), turn the bed warmer down so i don‚Äôt feel like a fried chicken, stay away from massaging the actual joints, etc.

Methotrexate and alcohol,post,"hi ra friends, i wanted to get other people's experiences regarding methotrexate and alcohol use (or lack thereof). i am going to bump up to 15mg per week starting next week. i have never been a big drinker. i take care of myself, and eat well. however, the idea of never being able to have a celebratory drink with friends while on vacation, or a glass of wine on a first date or something is really depressing to me and putting me in a funk. i have a tropical vacation planned, and i'm just bummed about it. my rheumatologist told me that no amount of alcohol can be condoned, and if i do decide to have a sparing drink, to run labs when i get back. i'm just trying to think about if i want to risk it or not. i'm soliciting thoughts, perspectives, and commiseration! :) thank you!

p.s. if anyone cares to share their views on methotrexate vs biologics, i'm all ears. i haven't yet had a bad experience with it, but i'm on a low dose and the idea of a drug that isn't so potentially liver damaging is appealing. i know the biologics have their own set of challenges, though. any experience or thoughts you care to share are very welcome!",11,138ym67,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/138ym67/methotrexate_and_alcohol/,1683314597.0,43,Methotrexate and alcohol,"hi ra friends, i wanted to get other people's experiences regarding methotrexate and alcohol use (or lack thereof). i am going to bump up to 15mg per week starting next week. i have never been a big drinker. i take care of myself, and eat well. however, the idea of never being able to have a celebratory drink with friends while on vacation, or a glass of wine on a first date or something is really depressing to me and putting me in a funk. i have a tropical vacation planned, and i'm just bummed about it. my rheumatologist told me that no amount of alcohol can be condoned, and if i do decide to have a sparing drink, to run labs when i get back. i'm just trying to think about if i want to risk it or not. i'm soliciting thoughts, perspectives, and commiseration! :) thank you!

Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"hi! i've been diagnosed since 31 (currently 38) tho i had symptoms since my early to mid 20s. 

rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive disease. it started out in my elbow and my thumb joint. it then spread. so now my hands, wrists, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet and oddly enough my jaw on both hinges have all flared at one time or another. my knee caps are also weak so when i stand up during a flare there is a good chance i could have my kneecap slip out of place too which is a whole additional level of excruciating pain. 

thankfully my dr who diagnosed me at 31 is a good man (not good bedside by any means) but has always  taken me for my word and has done what he can to make  sure i'm not in constant pain and adjusting/ changing meds as needed. 

i didn't have that much luck as a younger woman - most drs focused on my weight, my dietary habits or my stress levels. it was frustrating to not get help for something that kept occuring. i even had one dr say the arthritic nodules on my arms were calluses from me leaning against my desk while i typed at work..yeah... no they freaking weren't. they disappeared once i got on proper meds. 

i've been on 4 different meds including pain meds. i stopped taking the injection biologic at 35 when i became pregnant (some of the other ones you need to wean off first before - this one he said to just stop when you find out). i was lucky and my symptoms disappeared with pregnancy (it's not guaranteed but was a positive side effect! haha!)  i was able to conceive within two cycles so no delay in fertility for me from the meds! 

however pain symptoms hit me like a freight train come 4 weeks after birth. took my injection and it did nothing. i switched to a pill version and have been taking that pill version since 2020. i am generally pain free - tho weather changes do create flares in my shoulders and knees. over the counter pain meds for 12 hours usually does the trick!

i do have damage in my hands and knees - there's no changing that now - so i know as i get older there will be more issues. right now i'm working on just being as pain free as i can be to enjoy my life. i get blood work done every 6ish months and have been doing good at each of my check ins with him!",5,j2ag30j,,1672432398.0,242,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"hi! i've been diagnosed since 31 (currently 38) tho i had symptoms since my early to mid 20s.

My story- any advice?,comment,"hey, i really agree with the previous poster that for your well-being you're going to need to cut back some with all you're doing. work and grad school together is a lot for a healthy person to handle. experiencing constant pain while doing all that is imo maybe asking too much of yourself. in no way does that mean you're somehow weak or less than. you just have an extra load to carry.

in my prior post, i mentioned how driving myself mercilessly in grad school while in intense pain and needing hip replacements took a real toll on me. i was determined to try to go at the same pace as everyone else and denied that i had a hell of an extra load to bear. i refused to admit to myself that i was ""different."" well i ended up in a very severe major depressive episode, feeling panicked all the time, and trying to drink my pain away. i had to cut back or i might have ended up even worse off.

i don't know if any of this is at all helpful for you, but i'm hoping you might find something to relate to in my experience. perhaps it's time to cut yourself some slack. i can't really say; only you can decide that. üíî",3,jzwdbe7,,1694310348.0,169,My story- any advice?,"hey, i really agree with the previous poster that for your well-being you're going to need to cut back some with all you're doing. work and grad school together is a lot for a healthy person to handle. experiencing constant pain while doing all that is imo maybe asking too much of yourself. in no way does that mean you're somehow weak or less than. you just have an extra load to carry.

Pretty Upset just want to vent!!,post,"about six months ago i started having bad flares in my hands wrists and knees. every morning it's a surprise to find out what hurts. or what digit is stuck in a curled position if it's going to be difficult to walk.

 i just lost my medicaid and had to enroll in health care from my workplace.  between the time my medicaid ran out and the time that my new insurance will kick in is a two month period that i just have to wait and suffer.  im just feeling really pissed off about it because i was literally two vaccinations away from beginning some treatment!  i was so close!! 

i live on an island pretty far away from what most people would consider ""conveniences.""  for instance,  in order to see an actual rheumatologist,  i would have to travel because there isn't one where i live.  without medicaid, traveling will be a hardship.   but it looks like my primary doctor is willing to start me on methotrexate if i have an eye exam and i get the hep b vaccination, and i have no issue with doing these things.  on july 1st i can continue my forward progress towards treatment.

"Starting Arava (Leflunomide). Taking it by itself, is that normal?",comment,"there's no one silver bullet for the condition so it may mean trying a few things out to see what works for you. in my experience they'll say 12 weeks for something new (and then maybe give it longer if there's no immediate result. )  
i had about 8 months of guessing until i progressed to a biologic.   
prednisone to try to control the symptoms while we tried out methotrexate, then added hydroxychloroquine and then leflunomide.  
once there was demonstrated benefit from the adalimumab we were able to drop the prednisone, then the leflunomide, and most recently, reduce the methotrexate dosage with a view to discontinuing that too.   
the prednisone came with the most danger so i was under constant pressure from my rheumy to stop taking that, and then the leflunomide had the most likelihood of side effects so we were both happy to see the back of it. (i keep some prednisone on hand if i've had, or am planning on having, a really big day. )  
i'd say they want you to stay away from methotrexate (which is the most common treatment) because of your age because it ""is not recommended in pregnancy or while trying for a baby. this medicine can stay in a woman's body for 6 months after they stop taking it. for men, there is a risk that methotrexate can damage sperm. this can affect the way a baby develops during pregnancy."" (nhs). (constantly hear of doctors assuming potential pregnancy despite patient protestations 'just to be safe'.)  
definitely ask what their thinking is for peace of mind.   
for the record, i woke up to go for a wizz the first night after taking the biologic and found i could walk pain-free for the first time in 9 months. not a dream: just hit the right drug finally.   
i'd also recommend hitting up old posts (maybe searching for leflunomide as long as you don't get worked up about tiny chances of side effects) to see other newbies war stories as well as all the healthy lifestyle stuff (and placebos) that can help you cope.   
for my hands (and wrists) i did heat and cold in the mornings (hot shower, ice in the sink full of water, strap-on ice packs, pressure gloves. )

If you need a little hope‚Ä¶,comment,"ra is an autoimmune disease. it is triggered by your immune system reacting to foreign substances which cause you to make autoantibodies which attack your own tissues.
the responsible immune system involved is that of your gut tissue.

some people find that by keeping a careful log of everything they eat, drink, etc. each day and noting flare ups, good days, bad days, etc. you can often work out what that substance was. a journal is also useful to track meds and symptoms.

if you google, you will find that many people have found grains to be such an antigen, e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, etc. i am one of those.

a big clue that food is involved is that your ra symptoms always improve when you fast (e.g. you are ill and can't eat much). another is that your  symptoms change when on holiday and your diet has changed.


so 1. keep a diary, 2. try a grain free diet for 1 month.

with ra, everyone seems to be different. some people have shown fantastic improvement by avoiding certain foods, some improve on a certain med while to others that med makes them even worse.

only you know what affects you. your doctor can only advise but it is you who are going through the pain and suffering. you need to research what an autoimmune disease is, log your details and work out what substances may be affecting you.

as an example celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that can be successfully treated by simply avoiding certain glutens. most celiacs are sensitive to one particular gluten e.g. wheat gluten, rye gluten or barley gluten. but it has been found that about 20% react to a different substance (e.g. the gluten in oats). for those 20%, they have to work out what that substance is.

ra, celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases are all closely related, often symptoms overlap and doctors find it hard to distinguish between them because the spectrum of symptoms are so wide.
 
with my ra, if i avoid all grains then my symptoms improve dramatically but if i eat some gluten-free breads, i get a bad flare up the next morning. so i seem to be sensitive to something else in some breads , not just wheat.

i can eat rice (which is a grain and so does contain rice gluten) with no problems. i have not tested myself on other specific grains apart from wheat ( i made my own bread using only wheat flour with very bad results which was actually how i discovered all this stuff about grains and ra and that it was a 'thing'!).",2,ja22zdx,,1677394646.0,254,If you need a little hope‚Ä¶,"ra is an autoimmune disease. it is triggered by your immune system reacting to foreign substances which cause you to make autoantibodies which attack your own tissues.

Biologic fears,comment,"ok here is my experience as i have been on several of these meds:

remicade (infusions): if you can handle blood work you can do infusions. once a month at  a hospital for several hours is annoying but it‚Äôs a miracle in a bag and i definitely felt the difference walking in vs walking out. the whole time you are in a place that can immediately attend to your needs if there was to be a medical emergency, which is very rare. i think even with anxiety and thinking about the worst case scenario, it‚Äôs hard to not take solace in the fact that you are in exactly the right place of an emergency we‚Äôre to occur. a whole team of trained professionals at a moments notice. and once you‚Äôre all out there is practically no risk of anything drastic occurring. 

i was on remicade for several years and the worst thing that happened was sometimes the iv would be itchy, i tell the nurse, she slows the infusion down, itching goes away. also liked that the nurses could do blood work and iv in one poke! 

embrel: self injections created a lot of anxiety for me. these days i think they improved the formula so it doesn‚Äôt sting as much anymore. when i was on them it stung so bad and i had to hold it for at least 10 seconds on my leg. awful. i kept skipping dieses and after a panic attack i told my rheumatologist i can‚Äôt do this anymore. medication did work though, but bad fit for me. 

xeljanz: it is a newer medication and the long term effects aren‚Äôt as well known as the other medications. i have been on it for 7 years and love it, but i get the risks and that not everyone is comfortable with them. the once a day pill medications are the least hassle with the same potency as the other medications. 

side effect lists for medications: most side effects are not likely, in studies any time the participants have anything that could be side effect it has to be reported. so most lists are long and scary but the majority of the side effects are likely not caused by the medication itself. for many medications there are probably 2-3 key risks that are actually worthy of concern, and a doctor can help walk you through those risks in relation to your medical history. but if they want you to take a medication they are recommending it because they thing the risks outweigh the benefits, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt make the recommendation at all.",9,jf38t3v,,1680722138.0,231,Biologic fears,"ok here is my experience as i have been on several of these meds:

Enbrel - infections & HPV ?,comment,"i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a really tough disease even when everything else is fine with your health.

i don't have the aversion to medication to the degree that you do, and i still had to really think about it when i was put on hydroxychloroquine. it worked fine for a bit but then my ra suddenly turned severe and aggressive. i went from having some relief to unable to do much of anything except shuffle when i wanted to walk and unable to hold on to most things, even a pen. i would have to use my other hand to pick up the pen and then place it in my right hand.

i was put on orcenia infusions 3 months ago and within a week of the first infusion, i started to feel better. it's now been 3 months and i feel so much better with very little pain and more flexibility.

all of this is to say that sometimes you can't know before you go. i was told that i will have a greater chance of infections so i increased my supplements such as vitamin c, to do everything i can to help my immune system since the infusions are aggressively affecting the cells that are attacking the joints.

no one here can or should give you any type of medical advice but what we can do is tell you what we have experienced. i'm very happy with the results and i take it one day at a time. i also heard that treatment can work for a while and then not, so there's no way to know.",2,k1m9deh,,1695329037.0,355,Enbrel - infections & HPV ?,"i'm sorry you're going through this. it's a really tough disease even when everything else is fine with your health.

Could this be RA?,post,"hi all, 

i'm at a loss with my symptoms and hoping for some insight.

i was diagnosed with uveitis in january and have had 2 episodes to date. i have also had recurrent scleritis in my left eye since march-ish, pretty much ongoing with intermittent improvement with prednisone (on my third taper). chronic dry eyes. for about a month when i first got really sick i could not cry or make tears out of my left eye at all.

i've had random swollen joints, mostly knees and hands but have had ankles and feet as well. i wake up with crazy stiffness every morning that lasts about 1.5 hours. i have muscle pain as well. i also have raynaud's and livedo reticularis. 

i've had sores in my mouth pop up when other symptoms flare. i have geographic tongue diagnosed by an oral pathologist. my right ear feels full and plugged and causes hearing loss whenever i go off prednisone. 

some low grade fevers. exhaustion, weakness dizziness, tachycardia, high bp, nausea, and constipation symptoms all flare up when off prednisone. i've had hair loss. i have had had weird blood pooling in my feet and facial flushing.

my bloodwork shows next to nothing. i have a low positive ana (1:80 speckled) and have had high esr and crp during flares. i've also had high platelets, low wbc, and rbc in my urine. mild anemia but no iron deficiency. negative rf. negative ena panel. my rheum is testing anti-ccp and anca next. 

he initially thought i had sjogrens and put me on hydroxychloroquine 4 months ago. i had a lip biopsy which was negative so he took me off the hcq 3 days ago because he said ""it won't do anything"" because he doesn't think i have a connective tissue disorder. 

i'm at a loss. my ophthalmologist says she can't do anything more for the scleritis because it has to be managed with systemic treatment which my rheum needs to deal with. i'm only on 10mg of prednisone and tapering for the next 8 weeks, and now no hcq. i said i thought i had been helping with the livedo reticularis and dry eyes but he doesn't care and doesn't listen to me. 

does this look like it could be ra? by my own googling it seems like the ccp test is to rule out ra which he obviously doesn't think i have if he took me off the hcq. i feel like if those tests are negative he will just send me back to my family doctor. i'm just devastated. i started crying in his office because i have been sick for 9 months and he dismisses essentially all of my symptoms.
