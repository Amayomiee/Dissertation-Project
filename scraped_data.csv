Do you ever get past the nausea from Methotrexate?,post,"So it’s been a month since I started, and I get ‘try not to puke Monday’ because that’s the day I take it, but eventually do you get past ‘only nauseous when I stand Tuesday’ and ‘step away from the coffee Wednesday’? Because there is a lot of standing in my life and I really like coffee. I’d just like some hope that after a few months Tuesday and Wednesday are off the board to help me get through this.",11,102uo6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/102uo6o/do_you_ever_get_past_the_nausea_from_methotrexate/,1672808903

Do you ever get past the nausea from Methotrexate?,comment,"I started MTX around May and the first few weeks were hell. I took it on Sundays and had to work on Monday with a raw throat from puking.

I also weaned myself from coffee because I started have massive migraines and GI issues related to my RA and anxiety. I work in healthcare.

But I slowly increased my MTX and nausea didn’t get worse. And now there is no nausea at all.

I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,Make sure you make your Rheumatologist is aware of your symptoms and ask for a referral to a pain management physician. If the pain is as severe as you are describing you need medical/pharmaceutical solutions not  homeopathic remedies.,19,jb51882,,1678112283
I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"A few things that helped my pain other than meds which definitely help. 

1. I have a steroid pack prescription ready to fill anytime. If I get to where I want to forcibly remove my hands to remove the pain, I fill it. 

2. I fought against my doctor's recommendation about going Paleo for so long. I finally got desperate and it helped me a ton. I went from having average pain days of 5 with a max of 9 to average pain days of 2 with a max of 4. I honestly am mad at past me for not doing that sooner. 

3. I switched to a biologic. It's expensive (there are programs that can help). It's an injection. I feel sick 1-2 days after giving my shot.  But it's been a month and I've already seen a massive improvement. Not just in my pain but my energy which I never thought I'd get back. I've been on it over a month. It started kicking in 2 weeks ago but my max pain has been a 2. 

I also agree with the previous commenter. That sounds like pain worth considering pain meds. I'm so sorry you are going through this.",15,jb54hl9,,1678113777

I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"Uh, if you're screaming in pain your meds aren't working. You need something else. Not only are you in pain, but the pain means inflammation isn't under control and your joints are eroding. Unless you have so much joint damage that you're bone on bone, your goal should be very little to no pain most of the time. Current medicines can accomplish this. I don't know why so many people accept less.",6,jb7j8qw,,1678149937
I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"I'm on plaquenil and Actemra infusions.  I've had RA for 21 years and started on methotrexate but had side effects and it wasn't effective by itself. So I'm doing multiple meds now. Plaquenil by itself doesn't work and even my monthly Actemra infusion by itself wasnt working well. But the 2 combined has me fairly comfortable, I do still have flares but I can usually rest and take it easy to help. If I'm absolutely miserable then I will ask my rheumatologist for prednisone.  It loosens my joints up and reduces swelling very fast but there are side effects to it so I try not to take it often. Also I live on ibuprofen which also has unfortunate side effects but if I don't take it when I wake up then it takes me alot longer to get around. I avoid prescription pain meds because they make me sick and sometimes I feel worse after(migraines especially). 

Talk to your doctor,  yes this is a painful disease but you don't have to resign yourself to hurting all the time. Sometimes it takes awhile to find what works for you. I will say that cutting sugar has helped me alot.  And I try to limit processed foods, I still eat them but I've cut back quite a bit.  Best of luck to you!",4,jb87pv0,,1678161506

I am now just on Humara auto injector 1 once every two weeks. It helps but i may start methotrexate again as I noticed it helped with the pain. Although my rheumatologist let me stop it for a while to see how i would tolerate. Unfortunately, the pain increased especially in my spine as I also have scoliosis. I slept with a pregnancy pillow to help with pain during sleep. It helped, but my medication and exercise helps the most! I highly suggest strengthening the muscles around your joints as it helps with pain. Look up therapeutic exercises for specific body parts. Find what works for you and stick to a routine. Try not to go to heavy on weights and reduce high impact activities. And stretch before and after sleep! Hope this helps!",2,jb5ap07,,1678116447
I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"Definitely let your Rheumatologist know. There are many options for meds, and combinations of meds that treat the source, not just pain meds that mask how out of control your RA is. However, pain meds and prednisone steroid are really helpful for short term use during a flare. As others have said, diet can be helpful to lessen symptoms,  gluten free, Mediterranean,  limiting sugar or alcohol, you will have to try a few things to see what works for you. When you're feeling better some form of gentle exercise can be important to keep you moving. Hope you feel better soon.",2,jb77hky,,1678144720
I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"I have rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and fibromyalgia (all for 6 years ago far) Before 3 weeks ago, I had terrible pain in my joints and muscles. Absolutely terrible. This had gone on for about 5 years. My GP suggested to me to stop eating ""added sugar"" foods and to start an elimination diet to see what foods my body doesn't like. Actually, here been suggesting it for 3-4 years. Finally the misery was too much. I took his advice and began following a strict diet of clean organic food. After 10 days of zero sugar, fish, chicken, and non inflammatory foods, there has been a significant reduction in pain as well as brain fog, and my mental health has greatly improved. I'm not saying ALL pain is gone to but day by day quality of life has been improving by leaps and bounds. If you'll research no sugar elimination diets, and stick to it, you'll see how much you can improve. This has really opened my eyes to how much food effects our bodies- just as medications do. I'm almost pain free now ( 90%). I'm a new man. I thank my Doc daily, and kick myself for not listening to him earlier. I just didn't believe cutting out sugar could have this profound of a change, but I'm so glad it did. Please research this.",2,jb5bgt2,,1678116769

I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"RA is an autoimmune disease. You are ingesting something that your immune system is reacting to.
My guess is grains such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, etc.
It will be a class of food. E.g. fructose, sucrose, grains, cows milk.
You just need to find out which it is.
Celiac disease and ra are closely linked. Cows Milk casein and diabetes type 1 are also linked.
Grains are known to cause a leaky gut which lets through food to your immune systems gut lining. So removing grains from your diet is good but it may not be the only substance that your immune system does not like.

I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"Yeah totally. I know a lotta folks do an even more detailed version of this diet but that honestly wasn't feasible for me. 

So, for me, it's no dairy, no grains (so no gluten but also most gluten free stuff is off the table, no rice, no corn, no chickpeas), no beans/legumes (peanuts are technically legumes but other nuts are OK on paleo), no sugars except coconut sugar, maple syrup or honey and the trickiest is no preservatives. 

It's also no canola, vegetable or sunflower oil. So I use avocado, olive and coconut oil. 

Basically a lot of veggies with meat and spices, cashew milk that's only cashew and water, tea, eggs, fresh guac and salsa. I found a few sausages that are Paleo. 

I also have reintroduced peanuts (so I can eat at five guys, they use peanut oil) and corn. Next one is rice for me that'll unlock a lot of food if I can tolerate it. 

Look up Paleo online and I'm here if you have any questions. It's honestly not as bad as it sounds typing it out.",2,jbtl4xy,,1678552941

I need suggestions for Rheumatoid Arthritis pain!,comment,"It's not what you eat. It is what you don't eat that counts!
Paleo is a silly idea, but many people find that it does have a great positive effect because of the foods that it cuts out of your diet.
Your immune system has been triggered by a particular food substance and the autoantibodies that are produced attack your synovium because the proteins in the synovium look very similar to the protein that the antibodies are targeted at.
So paleo says to avoid grains, legumes and milk and sugar and some carbs.
In fact you should find that only one of those is the trigger. The most common group is grains.
So make sure you avoid all flour, bread, pizza, pasta, cereal, etc.
Not many people have a problem with legumes.
Some have a problem with cows milk (jersey cow milk may be ok and goats, sheep's milk is ok).
I doubt sugar and carbs would cause a problem because the immune system would not be triggered by them.
Grains contain chemical substances which are specifically designed (by evolution) to upset an animals stomach and thus dissuade the animal from eating the plants seeds. The glutens disrupt the gut lining. Cows cannot eat a diet of pure grains! Cattle grain feed has to have added chalk (Tums) because they get stomach ache without it.
Don't take any notice of the gluten free label on foods however, that label is for Celiacs only (and even then only 80% of Celiacs). Just avoid any product containing any grains of any type.",1,jb8tfep,,1678175906

I feel so bad and alone with RA,post,"Hello everyone, I was diagnosed with RA 4 months ago and I am 31 years old 
… I just need to vent. 

This all all started with a torn meniscus in my right knee that went like that for a full year due to a misdiagnosis from my primary doctor, when I was getting ready to have surgery they discover inflammation and caught the RA. I honestly didn’t know anything about it, even when both my knees began to hurt a lot until the point I start having difficulty walking to get to the bathroom in my one bedroom apartment. I used to be very active, exercising every day, very independent… I was hungry for life and I pospone and sacrifice a lot during my young years in order to enjoy more later on… I feel such regret. Specially towards the diet and not enjoying more of what life has to offer before this diagnosis.

I am on methotrexate and Humira 3 dosis and I feel horrible. I started to lose my hair a lot and my RA symptoms are way worse, I started to have bad flare ups in my pelvis, knees, feet, arms and hands and started to lose mobility on this areas… specially after working (typing) or walking more than 30 min a day. My husband has been through it all with me but I feel so guilty that I’m putting him through this… it also has cause tension in our marriage because he feels responsable for me and I want to help as much as I can. 

I wasn’t able to get the meniscus fix due to R.A. Since it will make my knee worse and I also have like a congenital problem there since birth (which I didn’t had idea about) so I have to live with taking care of my affected leg so I doesn’t get worse (no more weight exercises or running) :(

I can’t sleep… there are nights I can’t sleep at all… due to the pain, the anxiety, the fear… I feel my hands itching, my hands and arms stiff, my legs feel weak to support my own body… I feel so frágil and vulnerable and I’m constantly wondering when this is going to get better (I’m so crying right now). I feel like this is a punishment and I just have to suck it up…(?) I try to be positive every day and do what I can but I feel bad with myself. 

I can’t imagine living like this for the rest of my life… I am desperate and all I can do is wait for the medication to work. 

Thank you for reading if you have come this far, I don’t know you but I appreciate you and your time.",29,165awgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/165awgu/i_feel_so_bad_and_alone_with_ra/,1693391219

I've been dx since 19 but I just tore my meniscus in June. I can't have surgery either and was told a knee replacement is in my future. You should share with your doc how you've been feeling. I was honest w my doc a few years ago that my anxiety and some depression was creeping in and she put me on Cymbalta which greatly helped. It won't always be so bad.

I feel so bad and alone with RA,comment,"I'm so very sorry you're having such a time and so much pain. I know it really sucks for you right now, because I've been where you are, but how you're currently feeling is bound to change with time. 

If I were in your shoes, I would contact my doctor and ask about getting a prednisone script to help with your symptoms until your DMARDS have time to take effect. It sounds like you're just starting Humira (3 doses?). How long have you been taking methotrexate or have you just started that as well? Can I assume you're seeing a rheumatologist? You could also contact or visit your primary care doctor to inquire about a medication to help you sleep, because chronic insomnia can just make everything worse. 

It's not your fault that this is happening to you, and you've nothing to feel guilty about with regard to your husband and  marriage. You are not being punished for anything at all. You've just had back luck with developing RA, and you did absolutely nothing to cause your disease - nothing at all.

I feel so bad and alone with RA,comment,"I have been through a lot of what you described—and actually had to use crutches for months just to move from my bed to the bathroom. Then couldn’t use the Crutches any longer because the joint swelling went into my fingers and wrists—so had to be in a wheelchair. 

At this time, I’m no longer in a wheelchair and no longer use the crutches. 

What you said about waiting for the medicine to work is exactly correct. That’s a BIG part of conquering early RA and addressing it quickly. My advice on this is—When you are given a new DMARD therapy to try—if you don’t experience AT LEAST 20% improvement within the first 2-3 months, a new medicine must be tried. You will have to keep doing this until you find the appropriate medicine that works for you. For me—rinvoq was my savior. I blew through humira (weekly), Enbrel, all of the oral meds including MTX injections, and finally rinvoq was able to get me to 60-70% back to the way I was. After that, I actually had stem cell injections done both directly in my joints and via IV infusion—which with the rinvoq was a gamechanger and some days I can honestly say I’m at 90% and feel like maybe one day I’ll go back to the way I was. Good luck. I felt like dying for around 1 year until we finally were able to get the treatment right. Crying every night from the unbearable pain. I’m glad I didn’t end my life (I’m only 39 yrs old), but golly I sure fantasized about it every day before. It is hell but you can and will get through this!

(I forgot to add—I was on prednisone 60-80mg daily for 3 months straight initially to control the severe swelling in my knees, ankles, feet and hands—cortisone joint injections in my knees literally worked for 5 days then the swelling came back—it was a nightmare. Like you, I was a vegetable in bed all day because I couldn’t walk from all of the swelling. Sounds like you have it really bad. Feel free to message me privately if you need someone to talk to.

I feel so bad and alone with RA,comment,"Thank you so much for your kind response, I truly appreciate it! I was on methotrexate and prednisone only for about 2 months before starting on Humira. Prednisone help me a lot with the pain during that period but… the R.A. Keep advancing and got very aggressive to the point that I wasn’t able to walk or use my hands at all. I am unable to cook, clean or work as before and it makes me feel useless to say the least. So, that’s why I’m starting biologics, my doctor explained that it takes around 6 dosis to start feeling better. So, I’m just hoping to get there soon. But I’m not going to lie, the side effects that all these different medications have had on my body so far have increased my fear of dead and dread. I know that I have better chances of getting ahead of my condition with the right treatment, but it’s so frustrating to feel that either way I don’t have a choice. Is either take the meds that are killing my body in a certain way or let the R.A. Do it.

Chronic illness and chronic pain is life-changing.

When I have really bad flare ups I take ibuprofen and it seems to help a bit. But I was starting to take it daily and it makes me worried that I’m consuming more and more meds. So honestly, I have been enduring without any extra medication some mild flare ups and crying until they get away. I read that is not advisable to take NSAIDs every day or too frequently. I want to minimize the harm to my body in the long term with so many and different meds. 😞",2,jyd7gux,,1693398967

Where do you exercise? And what precautions would you recommend? 

Also, thanks for the heads up on the folic acid, I forgot to mention on my post that I recently started to take Leucovorin in replacement to folic acid because it wasn’t helping at all with my hair loss. So taking one day at the time with that one. 
Also, I completely agree about doctors and medical team don’t doing their best for our mental health while going through the process and it’s very hard and overwhelming, thank you for your support I’ll definitely reach out with more questions.

I used to get infected follicles in my pubic area and in my arm pits years ago and I never knew why. I've been on almost every biological sense remicade I'm currently on rinvoq now. I've been fortunate to not suffer  from really any side effects from my medications. The only damaged besides my joints is my esophagus and stomach some years back I am terrible with time I started taking a daily nexium and now I take a nexium twice a day and if I don't I'll get heartburn because of the GERD ( acid reflux) . Which pretty much happens with everyone you can't take these kinds of anti-inflammatories and pain relievers and medications for this many years and it not damage your stomach. I love celebrex was bummed when I had to go off of it now I'm on meloxicam and it works well so far. I too am in the ( r) word , to where I don't really have any pain like I feel pretty dang good I just don't say the word because it seems to jinx me when I do lol

How much folic acid do you take with your methotrexate and when?,comment,"I take 1mg/day (including mtx day) and I also take 20 mg leucovorin (folinic acid) the day after mtx. My rheum is at one of the top rheum departments in the US and she says her colleagues are very liberal in prescribing folic acid and folinic acid. The standard in her dept is 1-2 mg/day and consider folinic acid in addition to (or instead of) folic acid if the patient still has side effects.

The idea of withholding folic acid on mtx day is becoming outdated. The current thinking is folic acid does not prevent mtx efficacy for autoimmune disease (unlike as a chemotherapy). I do not know if there is super convincing human data comparing mtx 7x or 6x weekly, but I saw a study in a rat model of RA recently.

Keep in mind if he does have side effects even with the folic acid he can consult his doc for a dose increase or an Rx for folinic acid. The folinic acid is more expensive but it's a few pills 1x weekly instead of a daily pill.

How much folic acid do you take with your methotrexate and when?,comment,"I wondered about that. On one hand it seems logical that you would want a mega dose to combat the way methotrexate is given all at once. But on the other hand, does that megadose linger long enough in the body to protect between doses? 

It looks like a low dose takes 1-3ish days for the body to eliminate it, but I would assume the worst of any damage would be dealt that first day or so. Folic acid is excreted within 24 hours, so a megadose timed right should protect against that early period but if you take longer to pass the methotrexate you'd would be vulnerable after that single folic acid passes through.

Take it with food and if you can some carbs. 
Drink more water all the time. Not just the the day of methotrexate dose. 

Make sure your rheumatologist gives you folic acid to take every day. This will help with mouth and nose sores.

I was worried for a while that it wasn’t helping, but I had to skip a couple doses so I could get vaccines, and the pain and everything with the RA got so much worse while I was off the MTX.

Methotrexate,comment,"This is my personal opinion but it is verifiable with due diligence.

Methotrexate is a game of chance. And even then the best you can hope is a lifetime treatment with generally no remission. There are a few reports of persons experiencing remission but I suspect remission was probably due to some other factors such as diet change, or something that changed the microbiome (probiotics, fermented foods, fiber etc.) . Big Pharma has declared that RA is incurable and drugs may provide pain relief and perhaps stop progression of the disease. This is the basis for getting FDA approval.

Some people get no side effects and some get very serious side effects so a large number of users dropout from the treatments. The drug manufacturers state that there is potential for damage to vital organs but usually for people with weak ones. They recommend tests for liver, kidney, heart, lungs etc prior to treatment and periodically during the lifetime treatment. That is a lot of blood tests.

Methotrexate works by suppressing the immune system and therefore there is a higher risk of catching other infections as stated in the drug literature.

There are a few doctors who have practiced natural cures with great success but astonishingly, most people have not noticed. This could be due to many ineffective natural cure practitioners who do not fully understand the nature of the disease and use hit or miss approach. Also there is suspected counter propaganda by conventional medicine against all things natural""

The disease is best explained by Dr. Susan Blum in a book titled ""Healing Arthritis"" and a companion book ""Immune System Recovery Plan"". I find the treatment plan is not well organised and too complex and expensive""

I find the practical, fast and almost cost free approach is described in a book by Dr. Giraud Campbell titled, ""A doctor's Proven New Home Cure for Arthritis"". according to user reports most people achieve complete cure within a week. For continued remission, you have to eliminate certain RA triggering foods which are discovered in the process.

This process certainly worked for me in less than a week.

But once you get on the Methotrexate bandwagon, you may forfeit your chance of achieving success depending on how long you have been on it and other Allopathic drug history. It may still be possible to achieve significant reduction in pain but the process may take months or years to undo the damage caused by the drugs.

The process works on the premise that RA is related to gut microbiome and certain diets can improve the gut biome and eliminate the root cause of RA.

In order to insure the process to work, the doctor requires one day of fasting and colon cleansing to reduce the load of bad bacteria in the colon and make room for good bacteria. More and more clinics and organizations are acknowledging the role of gut bacteria in the causes of inflammations such as RA and many other diseases.

In fact a German clinic has practiced this approach for about 50 years and cured several hundred thousand patients with a one week stay in the clinic.

It is worth reading the books mentioned above. Used ones are often found for $6 to $8 each and sometimes less. Even if you don't want to go that route it will provide valuable perspective.

The great thing is you can switch to conventional treatment in the rare case it does not work for you. It costs virtually nothing, no special medications, exercise, medical visits etc.

But once on drugs, it is very difficult to go to this approach as drugs are suspected of doing near permanent damage.

There are some potential root causes of RA which may prevent effectiveness of any treatment, Allopathic or Holistic. These are heavy metal poisoning and some viral infections. Al liquid Zeolite treatment is advertised as a cure but requires more due diligence.

Methotrexate,comment,"It’s chemotherapy (poison), so the side effects can be really bad. Week 3, I stopped urinating, got a screaming headache, and my feet and legs swelled up painfully. Kidney problems.

I was so sure that I wasn’t going to get sick.

Even the vertigo and the constant crackling sounds in my ears would have been livable if it got rid of my pain.

Methotrexate side effects advice please?,post,"UK, NHS treatment here.

This post isn't about knocking Methotrexate and I don't want to hear anyone's horror stories please. I would however like some sensible feedback regarding possible side effects please. 

Been taking 10mg Folic acid and MTX 15mg pills the following day, for 6 weeks now. 

At my most recent rheumatology appt they said my inflammatory markers had come down which is good news. 

When I described the side effects I was struggling with however, they dismissed them as all in my mind and absolutely not caused by MTX.  
They even said that the headache the day after taking the tablets only happens for the first two weeks, which is not my experience at all.

I'm getting continuous low mood / depression, brain-fog, tired aching muscles in my legs and acid stomach with bloating and wind. (Also alterations in food taste, but that's something I can work around.)

I'm also getting severe tinnitus and a bad headache plus migraines, all of which last around 3-4 days, after each dose. They literally said all this was caused by 'anxiety' and couldn't be caused by MTX.

They offered me Leflunomide as an alternative, but said it had the same gastric side effects, and also Amitriptyline for the migraines / depression, but I declined both as the Leflunomide sounded just as bad and being an older person I don't want to add Amitriptyline to the burden of drugs my body's already dealing with.

I just feel so demoralised; are they correct that MTX couldn't cause these issues and I'm imagining it all?

Edit: I just wanted to thank everybody for all your responses - you've been really helpful and have given me lots of really good suggestions to think about.

I was pretty dismissive over that, but his suggestion was to take them in the evening, instead of during the day. That way, I would sleep through the worst of any side effects. 

That's what I did, and it really helped. Interestingly though, I recently had to take them much earlier in the day, and I was bracing myself for terrible side effects again - but nothing happened. It was absolutely fine. Perhaps my body has just gotten used to it more now, but it has made me think twice about his view on it being anxiety before.

Methotrexate side effects advice please?,comment,"I had a lot of the same side effects you're describing. The way my rheumy explained it to me is mtx is metabolized in the liver and the whole dose is processed over the course of two or three hours. Which is why you get those uncomfortable borderline hangover symptoms the next day.

I had horrific headaches the two days after a dose and the only way to get rid of them was folic acid. I also have chronic migraines but they're very different from the mtx headaches. Since folic acid inhibits mtx it's generally recommended to not take it the same day as your mtx dose so I skipped folic acid that day and doubled up for the day after. I was on 5mg daily so in essence I took 10mg the morning after my mtx. I think the max daily dose is 20mg but regardless make sure you're drinking enough water to properly metabolize it. 

There's not much to do about the mood but low dose amitriptylene does wonders. Amitriptylene can have some serious side effects but they're less risky on low dosages. I've been on it for years and it's helped my mood, pain, and sleep a lot.

Mtx is also pretty rough on the stomach. I know the mere thought of food and water is unpleasant the day after a dose but you need to eat. It truly helps. I lived on dry toast and black coffee although anything with ginger or mint in it also helped. If the gastrointestinal side effects are too much bring up injections with your doctor. 

There's a reason why people take doses on Fridays and then disappear for the weekend. Because the side effects can suck. Take it easy while you adjust. It can take a few months to really figure it out.",5,k0jyjos,,1694701254

A noticeable difference is that I take 5mg folic acid six days a week - could you try taking it through the week, not just the day before? (I've also noticed some people take the folic acid every day).

I would say brain fog and fatigue are pretty standard for both RA generally and mtx. The pills also gave me a horrible taste in my mouth.

Is it actually possible to have such well-managaed RA that you don't ever have pain/inflammation?,post,"Back story: I was diagnosed with seropositive RA 2+ years ago. I went through the whole Methotrexate trial, but ended up going off it once I hit the highest dose because it wasn't working well enough and it made me feel like absolute shit. I then switched to biweekly and now weekly Humira, which seemed to be working pretty well (aside from the constant fatigue) until recently. I've been having more and more pain in the limb where it all started (my right wrist/hand, which also happens to be my dominant hand -.-) and now I can feel that it's spreading to other major joints. I also feel even more fatigued than I used to. 

A veterinarian that I work with (I'm a RVT) that was also diagnosed with RA many years ago told me the other day that I should really think about talking to me Rheumatologist about switching to a different biologic. She said it IS possible for the disease to be much more well-managed and essentially be pain/fatigue-free for the most part, but that just seems like an impossible dream to me. Has anyone experienced this amazingness? I could use a little hope, heh.

Is it actually possible to have such well-managaed RA that you don't ever have pain/inflammation?,comment,"I’ve had RA since the age of 14 and now am 33. Initially, I relied solely on medication to treat the Illness and had a similar experience to you. Medications would work for a year or two, and then I’d have to switch. During this time I was always nervous about flare ups, the disease spread, and flare ups were awful. My knees would swell up to the point where I couldn’t bend them at all, and I couldn’t walk.  

About ten years ago I started tweaking my diet. I tried all sorts of things, but what really helped me a lot was a whole food plant based diet without salt, oil, or sugar. It took a lot of work but it’s been well worth it. I still follow the diet to this day. I actually managed to get off medications altogether between 2014-2021. I generally had one flare up a year, but otherwise I was doing well. 

Around 2018 I started to practice bikram yoga. This has been an absolute game changer and I recommend anyone with RA give it a try. It’s very challenging and in a hot room, but I find the heat really loosens the joints and after a session I’ve personally witnessed my swollen knees actually become less inflamed. 

In 2021 I had a nasty flare up that lingered. I was able to keep it at bay with the yoga, but eventually I realized that I could be better off being back on medication, so I started on Actemra again. Since then I feel fantastic. 

The thing I’ve learned is that RA is a nasty disease that can always rear it’s ugly head, and that you always need to be prepared for that. But I’ve also learned that you’ve got to do whatever you can to put yourself in the best possible position for success. Altering my diet has slowed the disease progression dramatically. The yoga has helped me regain motion in my joints. I’m in a far better place than I was back in 2014, despite having this illness. I would encourage you to try some serious diet modification and attend a bikram class.",3,j4g3p5l,,1673791392

Is it actually possible to have such well-managaed RA that you don't ever have pain/inflammation?,comment,"I have had RA for about 21 months, but got my official diagnosis only about 9 months ago in April. I think I spent Jan-May of 2022 at a level 7-9 pain on any given day (out of 10). I started steroids and methotrexate in April after my diagnosis and my hands/arms started feeling better almost immediately. Knees and ankles took until July to even start feeling better and it was August or September before I was walking somewhat normally. The pain has remained pretty much non-existent in my knees and ankles since then though UNLESS I overdue it. Then I just have like “normal person who did too much” soreness. Nothing I would consider an RA flare. 

The pain and stiffness in my wrists, fingers, shoulders and elbows started to come back intermittently in the fall though. I would be feeling 90-98% good one day and then the next day my pain level could be at an 8 in my hands. I remember on thanksgiving I woke up and all the knuckles on my left hand were swollen and red and I could hardly bend my fingers at all. So anyway, I was put on Humira (with methotrexate) around Christmas time. I am doing great on both so far. My 4th dose of Humira is in a few days. 

The Only 2 symptoms I now have regularly and  are fatigue (need to lay down around lunch or right after work for at least 30 mins) and then my middle finger on one hand just remains stiff and painful 24/7. But if one finger, on one hand is my only pain symptom… I call it a huge win. If not for that one finger I would be someone who went from level 9 pain to level 0 in the course of 9 months. For now though, I’d say I’m a level 1 because if the finger issue. When it hurts, it REALLY hurts but the majority of the time, I actually just forget about it. Anyway, there IS hope.",2,j6c1o2b,,1674974499
Is it actually possible to have such well-managaed RA that you don't ever have pain/inflammation?,comment,"I was a non-functioning human with extreme joint pain and fatigue; diagnosed four years ago. I spent 18 months trying out various meds that either didn’t work or were destroying other systems critical to life. So, I switched to the “new age” approach of trying to fix the problem through healthier living. Primarily, I ditched gluten and nearly all grains two years ago. Inflammation markers have been extremely low ever since. I live unmedicated and pain free. I am now a mid 80s golfer, play soccer with my kids, ski, and never have a twinge of pain. I still have occasional (but relatively rare) days of fatigue when I revert to poor sleep habits, but they never debilitating like they were a few years back. 
The disease (and Hashimoto’s) is still there, will eventually get worse, and I’ll likely need to consider other measures to manage it. For now, there are simply no signs of it in my daily life.
This obviously won’t be a viable path for everyone so I won’t advocate for the “fix it with food” approach (Auto-Immune Protocol) as a miracle cure, but I still feel immensely privileged every day I wake up and get to feel good.

Is it actually possible to have such well-managaed RA that you don't ever have pain/inflammation?,comment,"I’ll assume your rheum is trying not to spend your money on additional data points that they don’t think would change their approach to treatment. However, as an empowered patient (not someone with the expertise to be dispensing medical advice ) I’ll recommend getting the X-rays. They may provide a more complete picture of the current state of the disease in your body, and they’ll certainly provide a baseline against which you can track degeneration of joints through future X-rays.",2,j4f8zhn,,1673769028

I work in a funeral home, away from the families/services. I've been masking and trying to get people to mask coming in to my office. Most people are good, a couple are annoyed by it.

"Masking, Work, Etc ... Question?",comment,"One thing that's important to remember in these situations and difficult to quantify, is the fact that untreated RA is also immunosuppressive. You're often better off in terms of susceptibility to other infections when your disease is managed and under control, even with an immunosuppressant medication, at least that's how my Rheum framed it for me.

In the context of the pandemic? I'm still masking as much as I can. I'd like not to get sick (again), and the recovery implications for me and the delaying of my own meds if I were ill is enough to justify the hassle of a mask for me.",21,ivg0bni,,1667845398
"Masking, Work, Etc ... Question?",comment,"I would ask your rheumatologist whether or not this is necessary. They will have the best answer for you and your personal situation.

I've been told by my specialists that I need to be careful and that I'm high risk. I am on more meds than you are (one of them being methotrexate) and have other illnesses that contribute to my risk. However I know other people with rheumatic diseases that have not been told to be as careful as me due to different co-morbidities, being on different medications, disease activity and so on. I do know people who are Covid conscious and mask because they don't want long Covid despite not having an illness like RA. Ultimately it's what you're most comfortable with as we are all different.

We stopped distancing and masking outside of hospital settings after the last covid booster and haven't seen any trouble. This is with living in a city and traveling to Europe and Africa within the last year and a half with no more than a couple days of extra boogers. Also, none of that was with methotrexate, it was with enbrel, xeljanz and rinvoq at various points.

You barely feel anything and, at least with the single dose vials of MTX,  the medication isn't refrigerated so there's no weird feeling from it still being a little cold like with my Humira.

First time posting but I wanted to get everyone’s experience on Hydroxychloroquine.

Of course you could switch to injections but try the dinner trick first, it's the easiest. I also recommend 5 mg folic acid daily (expect MTX day) at first, then decrease the days you take the folic acid and see how far down you can go before you get nauseous.

And don't give up MTX! Some people need to take it a few weeks before the tummy gets used to it.",1,ja8nwe1,,1677519826

It is helping a lot already and it’s only been two months so once I get used to 5 I’ll work up to whatever my final dose will be. Taking half in the morning and half at night helps a lot too.

My symptoms were so bad I was having trouble walking or even lifting myself out of bed. I couldn’t squeeze toothpaste out of the tube or get dressed in the morning without help. I’m on week 4 of the MTX pills along with daily folic acid and it’s been life changing. I’m back to doing the things I was able to do before the symptoms started. I can run again and even do yoga. I feel like I have my life back! I too researched MTX and saw all the horror stories online. After the first dose, my stomach was upset and my heart rate felt a bit faster. But those symptoms have gone away. No hair loss. No tiredness but I purposely take the pills with dinner close to bedtime so I can sleep off any side effects. My energy levels the next day are perfectly normal. The pain is virtually all gone. The only other side effect I’ve noticed is that it’s easier to get sick with a suppressed immune system. I have a 5-year-old in kindergarten who seems to bring home germs constantly and I find myself catching a cold or getting a sore throat more often than I used to.

Positive methotrexate stories,comment,"Remember that the ones with horror stories are talking the loudest! Those of us doing fine with MTX are probably just getting on with life and so the conversation can be a bit horror-heavy. I've been on MTX for two years and here's what I can share/recommend, to think about with your own research and from the experiences of others: 

1) start taking your daily folic acid a few days before starting the MTX to prepare your system

2) take the folic acid every day religiously and consider adding a multivitamin if you don't already take one to help ensure your body's getting the nutrients it needs. I avoid taking any of these with breakfast, as I read that coffee can impede nutrient absorption and I'm not willing to give up morning coffee! So I take my folic acid and vits with lunch or dinner.

3) hair care: I don't know your hair situation, but if you're concerned about losing any, here are some tips - sleep on a silk pillow to extra insure against hair loss (but the folic acid should prevent that, as it does for most users); do not use any elastic hair bands ever, as they pull on hair leading to breakage and more loss from the roots; get plenty of ""good fats"" in your diet - olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, etc, and plenty of Vitamin D.

4) cut back on greasy, sugary, and overly processed foods to help your stomach manage the MTX better  - you don't have to cut them out entirely, just try to nourish your body with nutritious foods 80-90% of the time 

5) split your MTX dose - I take half my pills with breakfast and half with dinner every Saturday, to help guard against gastric distress, as recommended by my rheum 

6) If you have a standard M-F working life, take your MTX on the weekend so that if you do experience any fatigue or stomach issues you have the weekend to manage them.",3,ix9yzhl,,1669066875

Positive methotrexate stories,comment,"After a horribly quick and debilitating onset of RA symptoms, methotrexate (with hydroxychloroquine) helped me so much. It took about 2-3 months to kick in. My pain disappeared and I eventually went into remission. I started taking it a little over a year ago. 

I find the side effects tolerable and a more than fair exchange for getting my life back. I get a bit nauseous when I take it (which I think is partly related to me being anxious about being nauseous ironically...!), I had some photosensitivity at first and my hair is a tiny bit finer. All perfectly manageable. I try to eat a carb-heavy meal on the night I take it and I have ginger around in various forms to help me if I start to worry about nausea.

Nausea/vomiting with methotrexate,comment,"Does your doctor know about this? I mean, that's just not sustainable. Injections are an options and super easy, or switch to a different DMARD (I happen to take Arava with my Humira b/c MTX didn't work and gave me migraines.)

That said, it sounds like you're throwing up later in the week? I mean, methotrexate is different for everyone and can definitely be bizarre, but if your nausea is constant over the course of the week I would maybe look first at other medications/foods/habits.   


\*PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY\* I took prednisone one time for about a week, and it literally ate my stomach so bad I couldn't eat solid food for 2 months. I have had 4 kids, was on zofran the whole time for all of them, and the nausea was 500x worse than any of those awful pregnancies. I was so sick of being sick that I would wake up in the morning nervous to be sick and have to try to take care of my kids while laying on the floor, which would make me nauseous also. It was a vicious cycle. All of that to say - there are a lot of potential factors here and the fact that you mention you are worried about having to throw up might be making it worse. Switching to other mode of administration (injection) might be enough to disrupt the association with MTX and being afraid to barf, in addition to just not going through your GI system in the first place. Good luck!",1,jcwvped,,1679286195

Nausea/vomiting with methotrexate,comment,"\*Whew\*

Sometimes text convos can be a bit confusing as to what tone is conveyed, so I'm glad that's not how I came across.

Something I was taught in graduate school about analyzing research studies is to compare side effect percentages to placebos. MUCH of the time, you'll see that the placebo group had similar or even greater experiences of the same side effect.

For example: An older (and quite problematic) RA study came out that appeared to claim that RA patients had a higher incidence of cancer on a particular medication. Or at least, that's the takeaway folks understood from reading the SUMMARY.

The problem is - that's NOT at all what the research actually showed. In point of fact, the placebo/control group had significantly higher cancer rates than the ones taking the medication. Because RA (as do nearly all autoimmune) patients have a HIGHER cancer risk because of inflammation. MORE so for UNCHECKED inflammation due to non-treatment. Which is another reason we so STRONGLY recommend medical treatment.

But all anyone remembers, or essays/articles report is: THIS MEDICATION CAUSES CANCER!

Which, no. It doesn't. It never did. But if you Google it, you'll get hundreds of ""wellness"" and ""dx influencer"" sites stating very, very clearly it does. Then they hawk their dangerously unbalanced proprietary diet, supplements, program, etc all for a special introductory price of $$$$.

And that's incredibly dangerous for RA patients who avoid the medication that is VERY, VERY good for RA.

And here's the part that drives me bonkers: every 30 minutes the average body produces cancer cells. And generally speaking, our immune systems (yes, even OURS) handles them very, very well. After all, it has the very best practice at this. But the more misdirected and demodulated they become from non-treatment or under-treatment, the less efficient they are - so we really, really, really need to be on proper treatment so our wacky immune systems can FIGHT these ongoing onslaughts of developing cancer cells.

No modulation - no decent fight. It's like air dropping Marines willy-nilly all over the globe and expecting them to find the enemy attacking a small village. Our immune systems NEED modulation. And that's where the meds come in. Especially the one I'm referencing above.

That said - yes, we experience side effects. And they are horrible, annoying, inconvenient, etc. And a right bitch kitty. 

Sorting out whether these side effects are the disease or our meds - honestly, I don't try to sort ""correlation vs causation"". I let the doctors sort that out.",2,jcy296r,,1679318002

diagnosed this morning… advice? tips? words of affirmation?,comment,"I’m jaded and cynical about it but have been through the ringer so can answer pretty much anything and recommend everything under the sun.

How bad is it?
How many joints are affected?
Have they run your TB test to see if you need a course of INH?
Do you have a good support system?
Do you have any other autoimmune diseases yet?

1. Find a doctor you trust and can work with well. They need to be patient-centered.
2. Get over any lingering fear looking stupid because your life needs to be about comfort going forward.
3. Never push yourself too hard or you’ll be on your butt in bed for days/weeks.
4. Learn your pain limits and signs of approaching those limits. Stop 15 minutes before the limit to save yourself agony.
5. Prednisone is your friend.
6. You may try, and fail, several drugs before you find one that works for you.
7. Use Motrin but not as often as the bottle indicates you can. It will eventually give you issues and you’ll be told to seriously limit your use of it.
8. Ice and heat are your friends. You’ll find which time of day your body prefers ice/heat. Invest in good hit/cold pads etc. The heated mitts are fantastic.
9. Ask for help and don’t do things that you really shouldn’t.
10. Depending on which joints are in play you should consider Lidoderm patches.
11. If your veins suck and a port is recommended for you then jump on it. You’ll love it.

Biologics possibly failing/ maybe developing inflammatory bowel disease?,post,"Hi everyone! 

First time poster here so please bear with me. Has anyone ever experienced their biologics failing so soon after beginning them? For reference- I was initially diagnosed with potential psoriatic arthritis, and went for a second opinion which was later changed to seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. I started taking the Etanercept biosimilar (Erelzi) in April 2022. Prior to that I had no success with Methotrexate, plaquenil (very bad mental health while taking this with awful nightmares and ideation) and sulfasalazine with allergic reaction. Once I began the biologics I noticed a dramatic increase in my health and felt great, however it’s been a struggle to stay on them consistently due to constant infections. We were hit hard with Covid in July and I ended up hospitalized on supports, did the whole dosing schedule of Paxlovid etc. but obviously suffered immense setbacks during this time. Shortly after this I continued having upper respiratory infections which again necessitated stopping at the advice of my dr. I’m noticing since restarting the medicine that I just don’t feel …well, good at all? I was hoping as I approached that 3 month benchmark things would level out, but my energy levels continue to be ridiculously low, I have a lot of pain, swelling and redness, and I’m now suffering immensely in the bowel department. BM’s tend to be riddled with mucus and blood (SORRY 💩) and are never solid. I have lost around 42 lbs in under a year, and quite frankly I look half alive at this point. Has anyone ever experienced this? My mom had a history of psoriasis, and passed away from stage 4 colorectal cancer in her early 40s (I was 23 at the time) and my grandfather ended up developing crohns in his 70s and sadly passed in ICU after having surgery to remove the damaged bowel/colostomy bag.

Throw a fit and have them check you twice. It MUST be a PCR test, as that’s the gold standard. I was negative for my first test and positive for the second.

Biologics possibly failing/ maybe developing inflammatory bowel disease?,comment,"There are a lot of good suggestions here- one more idea to consider is seeing a naturopath (not sure if those are just as hard to access in Canada?).  A few years ago I developed GI issues, could barely eat and lost 20 lbs in six weeks. My experience was that the gastro did an endoscopy, results were normal and she basically told me I was fine. But I still couldn’t eat.
I eventually sought out a naturopath and she did a ton of different tests and it helped us map out a strategy to improve my symptoms. I am not at all suggesting you not seek traditional medical care, but this might be an option in the meantime to see if they can help pinpoint (or at least narrow down) the cause while you wait.",2,j0chj84,,1671125081

Did you have to do any specific tests to figure out your Humira was failing? I’m seronegative, so on the worst of days my bloodwork is usually still decently normal, and most of my X-rays/ultrasounds haven’t shown anything of note because I’m still very early in the disease progression. I did do some MRI a few months back, and I’ve been waiting for my next appointment to discuss results (they were looking for potential AS because I’ve been having a lot of spine and hip pain and realized at some point I tore my labrum according to the lower MRI) but that appointment is a bit away still with the holidays coming up.",2,j0ccps5,,1671123248

I've never had asthma so I wasn't expecting to get diagnosed with that but when I saw the pulmonologist he did a pulmonary function test and I showed signs of asthma. So he diagnosed me and gave me meds to help control it. But because I've had RA for so long he ordered a CT scan and it showed inflammation in my lungs. He said unfortunately the RA at some point got into my lungs and now they are vulnerable to be inflamed and damaged like my joints.  He acted quickly and put me on prednisone and I did 3 rounds of that over a 3 month period. Then had a follow up CT scan and it showed the inflammation was gone.

Another doctor, civilian, diagnosed me with Crohn's just by looking at me. As for the RA, I spent the years between 13 and 20 going to every hand doctor known. Because that is where my RA first showed. I even had to relearn how to write because they thought I was holding my pen wrong. No one ever asked me about pain in my other hand or elsewhere on my body.

anyone else on methotrexate?,comment,"I took it for about three years. First off I never found it helped me much but that's neither here nor there for side effects.
As for side effects they can be rough and I found them very rough at first. I started out right at 25mg so it was kind of hard and fast. I took it on Friday nights going to bed and took a Gravol with it to sleep through the night. Side effects never started for me until about 20 hours later so Saturday evenings weren't super fun.
The nausea everyone says it can cause, for me, is more ""gaggy"" if that makes sense? Like when you're starting to get a cold and your throat feels very raw I would describe it as. Make sure you take your folic acid as prescribed by your doctor. The day after you take it you'll probably feel what I describe as ""blah"". I took a dose of Robitussin DM on Saturday mornings to help with this. The dextromethorphan displaces the methotrexate in your brain and kills the ""blah"" feeling and any headaches. It also helps to do the shots instead of pills if thats an option for you to cut down on gastro symptoms and increase bioavailability.

anyone else on methotrexate?,comment,"I was afraid of this drug for years and never started meds (I was diagnosed at 17 and 30 now) due to scary things in the internet and my parents reading the same things I’ve been on it since august (take orally 1x a week)  and I wish I started years ago because it’s not that bad at all. 

the only side effects I have now are a little nausea the morning after I take it, and overall just a little more tired and thirsty the day after I take it. I do take folic acid daily which my rheumatologist said is meant to combat most of the bad side effects, so I guess that is working. I recommend taking it at night so you sleep through any nausea in those first 8-12 hours, and if you take it once a week be strategic about it. I wouldn’t take it on a Friday night because I want to feel my best on the weekend to be able to go out and do things like normal. 

Also, there are mixed reviews on alcohol and mtx. My experience is drinking the day after my dose I feel like crap…but if it’s 2 or more days after I feel ok with a few drinks. In general I wouldn’t go heavy on drinking because mtx is hard on your liver and alcohol will only make it worse. 

It took me a few months to start noticing a difference in my RA symptoms, so don’t get discouraged right away if there’s no difference. Also drink lots of water!! Idk why but it makes me extra thirsty and I feel dehydrated the day of/after.",1,j0gnyew,,1671201735

Finally got my diagnosis (seronegative RA),post,"So, after starting the journey to diagnosis, a hurricane blowing away my old doctors office, a few years of moving states and never getting established enough to get into a rheumatologist, and finally a long wait to get in with this rheumatologist, I had my appointment today and was diagnosed almost immediately based on my symptoms, and nodules, etc. 

It's been 15 years since I was diagnosed with arthritis (a general ddx, non specific), 5 since I  first saw a rheumatologist, 3.5 years since I discovered seronegative was a thing and it could be RAc after negative testing. 3.5 years of doctors telling me they can't help without the blood tests being positive, or simply that they ""don't believe"" in seronegative RA.  I feel relieved simply to have someone listen and not treat me like I'm overly dramatic or lying. I feel heard, even a little vindicated maybe. Glad to know I'm not dramatic or going nuts when I've sworn that's what I have for so long.

Anyway. She put me on folic acid and methotrexate 2.5 mg tabs (5 pills at once, once a week).

Finally got my diagnosis (seronegative RA),comment,"So glad you've finally been able to get treatment!

Some people are side effect free. Some aren't. Personally I get nausea between 2-4 days a week at varying degrees on methotrexate and sunburn on cloudy days. Most in person people I've met on RA that have symptoms have similar symptoms. So just be prepared to cover up in the sun/get big hats or umbrellas and if you get nausea either ask for folic acid, try an anti-nausea or cannabis. Overall though, methotrexate is an effective drug. I had less symptoms on the shot than the pills, as did several people I know, but that assumes you can work yourself up to the shot (or source it, as it has been difficult since Roe vs. Wade was overturned). 

Also beware - they aren't kidding about the don't drink. I've been told I can have 2 drinks a week on it, but even that can make the nausea suddenly kick in and get way worse.

Finally got my diagnosis (seronegative RA),comment,"I was told the same. Keep fighting to be heard. 

What is wild is, is great about a low pain threshold and stuff, but my gallbladder stopped functioning completely a year and a half or more ago, (I focused on the fact it was more likely gallbladder 1.5 years ago). I went through hell getting that dx because they kept doing ultrasounds and I didn't have stones at all, finally I called an ambulance and went to the hospital during an attack rather than waiting until the day after (I waited because who can drive while vomiting? But I was sick of getting blown off, and figured they'd listen if they witnessed the sickness.)  Finally they decided to do a HIDA scan and found out yeah, there was no stones or swelling, it just didn't operate at all. Totally dead. Which meant I had bile filled in my gallbladder and backing up into my liver, and no bile being released at all to help with digestion. My doctor looked over my records and was like, you've been like this for a year and a half, and your complaint is vomiting and sulfur burps? You should have been a 10 of 10 on the pain scale every day, and you answer, maybe a 4? How? And I'm like, my normal daily life is a lot higher than any of this feels, I think I have RA, but no diagnosis yet. He was like, keep fighting for that diagnosis. There is no reason the feeling of an organ death should not phase you because of how high your normal pain level is.

So people say I have a low threshold until they realize what my threshold is, then they are like, how do you survive?

I had a similar reaction to the docs who said they didn't believe.

I'm more than happy to accept another diagnosis that fits this if it's correct and I can get help, I just want help. So can you diagnose what is wrong with me with something you believe is real? Which of course, they can't, because it's seronegative RA, which they didn't believe in! I totally understood the doctors like my general practitioner who said, ""look, your factor is negative and I'm not a rheumatologist so I don't know enough to diagnose your seronegative, but I'll refer you to a rheumatologist."" That made perfect sense.

I also have bursitis in my hips. Doctor suggested that came from the way that I walk because of the RA especially during flares. So that's fun. Trying to comfort my joints in my knee and ankles has caused more harm in my hips and little comfort in my other joints.",4,k3t6539,,1696650039

It’s starting to bring my numbers down - but my pain and lost function in my joints is unchanged (as of now). I too have hip bursitis - so it’s really interesting they told you it’s from compensating for your joints!! I feel that. My feet feel like I’ve been walking on hard sandbags for years - I can see how that would affect my hips now. Thanks for sharing OP.

So ask your doc about it if the nausea gets bad. It might help a little. It can also be helpful to increase the dose if you get any other symptoms related to the methotrexate.

I'm like, is this really necessary? I hate being on meds.

Thank you for the advice! I will try that next time I am asked the pain level question.

Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,post,"Can anyone help me please. I am being told to start Anti tnf treatment for RA. 

I am currently on hydroxychloroquine twice daily. It helps but i have flare ups alot and the fatigue is a killer. I also have emotionally unstable personality disorder and complex ptsd. 

My body and mind works against me everyday. I work and raise two children. I have tried dmards but i am now running out of options as you all know all these meds carry a risk. 

I do not have any joint deformity and low levels of swelling my crp and esr are basically normal now. 

However flaring everyday,every thing is a struggle. 

I am not even sure that i need to be on anti tnf. The issue is you only get 10 mins once a year with a dr. 

I have briefly tried methotrexate but my hair started falling out so i stopped. 

I have scared myself silly with all these bigger drugs due to the risks of sepsis and certain cancers etc",3,154xrcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/154xrcd/terrified_of_going_on_anti_tnf_treatment_for_ra/,1689874940
Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,comment,"Please consider what rheumatoid arthritis does to your body without the drugs, too. I was diagnosed just prior to the earliest biologics, Humira and Enbrel came on the market, or if they were available, the doctors weren't using them much yet, at least where I live. So my choices were the DMARDS methotrexate (mtx), leflounomide, sulfasalazine, plaquanil, and rarely used gold injections. Yup, you read that right, gold injected into sick people.

At that time I was a hair stylist (another thing RA took from me) and one of my clients was a dementia nurse, and she was adamantly against mtx, told me it was poison, don't ever let them give it to me. She was incorrect, though. Methotrexate has turned out to be the best drug for me. It makes my biologic work better, and my liver labs are right where my doctor wants them. I've been on it for about 12 years now. It has outlasted a few JAK inhibitors, and now I'm taking Orencia with it since 2021, and also plaquanilall along too. So please don't listen exclusively to the doom and gloom about these drugs. They are what makes it possible for me and many others all around the globe to live a semblance of a normal life. Rheumatoid arthritis has taken so much from me, and had I not given in and agreed to try the meds, I would be even worse off now than I am.",8,jstqa0x,,1689913267

I've been on Methotrexate for a couple of months now, and it seems to have reduced the flare ups to about once a month. But I can relate to the feelings of the original poster - my Dr just put me on Xeljanz XR and I'm too terrified to take it. In an FDA study two years ago one of the doctors involved in the research said he wouldn't hesitate to give it to a healthy 50 year old - but would not give it to a 70 year old with heart or lung disease. I'm 69 yrs old, with both heart and lung disease (3 heart attacks, 4 heart operations, COPD).

Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,comment,"IMO anti-tnf's are a modern miracle of science. It blows my mind how the scientists patch together those protiens. Sure, I take them because they work, but also out of pure admiration that such a molecule could even exist. I mean, wow, this is some real futuristic stuff! I doubt anyone even could fathom something like this 100 years ago.

My reasoning is that if biotech spends that much $ on compounds that are so specific to many autoimmune diseases, have been around for 30 years, and are still prescribed, the safety profile is going to be much better than other less-effective drugs.

Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,comment,"I’ve been on multiple anti-TNFs starting about 9 years now and they were like a miracle drug for me, working within 2 weeks of starting treatment. 

Don’t worry about the risks, your doctor wouldn’t suggest it unless the risks and benefits had been collectively considered by the wider medical community.

Haven’t heard anything about anti-TNFs being carcinogenic either. I imagine the risk of sepsis comes from breaking the skin which is something that happens in everyday life regardless and very unlikely to progress all the way to sepsis.

And on your symptoms being mild right now, that’s great and I’m happy to hear that but these drugs are preventative as well as reactive - it’ll keep you well for longer. Often in my experience waiting to the point where you feel like you need it is already too late.

Help! This pain is insane!,post,"Was diagnosed a month ago with rheumatoid arthritis and my PCP started me on methotrexate 2 weeks ago. This Wednesday will be my 3rd dose. I don't see a rheumatologist until March because in a court city of over 110,000 people we have one specialist.

So to now. I'm in so much pain I can barely think. My hands are almost completely useless. Too much pain to pick up a phone or open a ziplock bag. Not just when I move. It's constant. I'm on 20mgs a day of Prednisone and it hasn't helped at all. I'm also using an nsaid gel.Not sure what to do. 

Our hospitals are full and I try to avoid them anyway. I have a compromised immune system that is even more so n now I'm on the methotrexate. This is as bad as some of the broken bones I've had pain wise. I can't do life in this much pain all the time. No sleep, can't eat. Any help or suggestions?

EDIT: Thanks you so much for all the comments. I've read them all and gotten some really good ideas from them. I will be replying to most of y'all but it's slow going with the swelling and the pain.

Help! This pain is insane!,comment,"You should try eating white button mushrooms daily or take a mushroom capsule such as agaricus blazei. It is something I started doing once I wanted to get off methotrexate and it is the only thing that has worked for me so far. If I don't take it within a 7 day span my inflammation hits me like a brick. It's the only thing that has kept it at bay since I got off methotrexate 2 years ago. For me personally, vitamin D, mushrooms daily or every 2-3 days after being consistent for a year, and increasing fish oil and flaxseeds, hemp, and chia seeds in my diet has worked to keep me pain-free. The first year getting off methotrexate I was still feeling achy and slow in my knees so I would also take hyaluronic acid with chondroitin sulfate and that helped me feel at ease. I was on methotrexate via injection for 2 years and it did help but it takes 6 months or so before it relieves you from what you are experiencing now. I'm not saying you should quit methotrexate but if you start the mushrooms now you might find the relief alongside with the medicine, and if you are like me you may be able to get off of it completely with time.

Methotrexate,post,So I was recently diagnosed with RA and was given methotrexate to take once a week to help with the pain(even though it doesn’t help). Is anyone on here currently taking this medicine and does it make you constantly feel sick and weak? And if so what have you done to help with that feeling.,9,13vvhbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/13vvhbt/methotrexate/,1685465481
Methotrexate,comment,"I have been on injected MTX for almost 10 years. This is purely my experience, but my side effects have gotten worse the longer I have been on it. For context, I'm also having other health concerns that likely play into that. But around year 7, the nausea, malaise and heart issues for 1-2 days after the injection got worse. It's still doable but just annoying.

That being said, it's an amazing medication. I likely wouldn't be able to function let alone hold down a full time job without it.

Different rheumies recommend different things. I personally have found that taking the folic acid every day and NOT skipping it on shot day helps my nausea immensely.",14,jm833d1,,1685466242

I’m not in remission yet and my rheumatologist wants me to try and increase the dose but I’m finding that difficult as the side effects are still “a thing”. When I first started taking it at a super low dose the migraines the weekend after and general exhaustion on the day I took it were brutal but as I slowly increased the dose I mostly got used to them. Unfortunately at 15mg I’ve been unable to totally get rid of the side effects, they’re not too bad (hence why I’m still taking it) but I feel pretty rough on the day I take it and then exhausted with headaches over the weekend so I don’t know how I could cope with a higher dose.",2,jm8l0ah,,1685473049

I’ve had it for 12 weeks now. As Alwayssnacking22 said, it suppresses your immune system leaving you open to catch infection and the can be quite a lot of side effects. Keep in touch with your specialist  and discuss pain relief options with them. It does take a good 3 months to settle in your system and you should be getting regular blood tests.

Methotrexate,comment,"I’ve been on tablet methotrexate for 11 weeks now and was a bit nervous like you at first. I started at 15mg + 5mg of folic acid the day after. On week 10 we upped it to 20mg + 5mg of acid because our improvement had stalled a bit and my consultant felt it should still be getting better.

Generally I get a headache the next day and some very mild nausea if I allow myself to get really hungry so I make sure to preplan what I am eating on Meh-mondays. For me I have found some things really useful;

1 - I take it on a Sunday night because Mondays are always shitty anyway and I’d rather feel a bit rubbish at work than on my weekend 

2 - I try to stay really hydrated on the Sunday and Monday in particular 

3 - I eat a carb heavy dinner on Sunday night at about 6pm, have an actamel at 9.45pm and take my meds at 10. I immediately rinse my mouth, mouthwash and brush my teeth. Then I go to bed straight away so I don’t obsess over it. For me this either physically or psychologically ‘lines’ my stomach and seems to help avoid the mouth ulcers others have reported.

4 - 2 walks a day, every day. At first this was literally opening my front door and taking 5 steps down the front path on a crutch. Now im back to gentle walks with my dog twice a day. Anytime I have skipped it I know about it and regret it without fail. 

5 - I try to work with it. It’s not always possible but I find I get really tired at about 2pm so I have scheduled my work day to take lunch at that time. If that means I need to set my alarm for the whole 30 minutes and go to sleep then so be it. 

If I stick to their routine the symptoms are really manageable. One week I had an upset stomach already and that definitely made them worse, and another I didn’t follow my routine because I was away and the headache was much worse the next day.

Stick with it; I’m still early on and still very much hoping for more improvement, but I’m not able to stand up off the sofa without spending 15 minutes mentally preparing myself for it, I don’t wake up screaming in pain in the middle of the night, I am only using a crutch for the stairs, I have taken my compression gloves and socks off AND I am fully off of ibuprofen and paracetamol so it is definitely helping me get my life back.

Please let me know if you have questions, all the best x",1,jmjaizt,,1685656939
Methotrexate,comment,"I just took my 5th dose of Methotrexate last night.  I’m on 20mg that I take all at one each week for Psoriatic Arthritis (that they thought was RA at first until the horrible lesions showed their nasty face lol.). I will say that have had some not so fun side effects so far, nausea spells that come with sweats, hot flashes and dizziness, I get major fatigue for the couple days after taking it and yesterday, I noticed my hair staring to thin and break.  That being said, I have started to feel better overall and my psoriasis elisions (that cover most the of joints on my hands, fingers and ankle) have started getting a little better.  

I actually messaged my rheum earlier tonight to update her on the symptoms and express that I’m anxious to switch to the injectable MTX and biologics and I hear those have way less side effects, so we will see what she says.

That’s my experience so far in a but shell!  I wish you the best of luck though, it’s all such a gamble on exchanging one symptom for another and choosing which is the lesser of the evils.  😂🥰",1,jml0vm1,,1685688892

Methotrexate,comment,"Age, diet, lifestyle, and general health (not to mention interactions with other drugs you may be taking) can all influence medication effectiveness.  If you are confident in the RA diagnosis, then consider those other factors as well as the medication you are prescribed by your rheumatologist.  I was originally diagnosed with RA 6 & 1/2 years ago (but had been already experiencing pain symptoms for at least 6 months) and was initially prescribed 15 mg methotrexate weekly (oral tablet) which was increased to 20mg/wk a few months later.  At the time, my only noticable side effect was a transient (24-hour-or-so) drop in energy after taking that medication.  However, I had also been prescribed meloxicam, 15mg daily, concurrently, and that eliminated nearly all my RA pain.  Over time, my weekly methotrexate dose has been reduced to 12.5mg and I now take meloxicam once per week, twice at most.   btw, I'm a long-time confirmed coffee drinker, and there have been studies done that suggest improved methotrexate tolerance among some who drink coffee (in moderation, of course), and while many people stop drinking it after being diagnosed with RA, I've decided that's a good enough reason for me to continue enjoying my java!  Folic acid (or folate, if preferred) can also offset MTX side effects and may also be prescribed by your MD.",1,jmtypjj,,1685857972

The Dr there was apalled and put me on humira immediately.  Too bad it was 2 years too late.  If they had given that to me 2 years before I may have stopped the RA. Then I was on prednisone and now on Orencia infusion.  I also got hashimotos from the Covid vaccine and have gotten a lot worse since then.  Orencia has worked the best.

Which Med Do I Choose?,comment,"I was given options and information and allowed to have input on what I started with -- between methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and plaquenil. I appreciated it.

I chose MTX because it starts working faster than plaquenil. It didn't work for me and had too many side effects to up the dose, so I was switched to leflunomide and humira. But, I could have skipped MTX if I wanted to have kids, for example, or if I wanted to be able to drink (totally get that you don't want to lose more stuff to the RA).

My partner's doctor didn't offer options and just started them on plaquenil right away, which has been working on its own for a while now. (If plaquenil works, it seems pretty good because you don't need constant bloodwork, just a yearly eye check. I feel like a pincushion, especially now that I'm doing humira on top of the bloodwork lol)

MTX gave me constant nausea and made me feel absolutely wiped out for 2 days after taking it. Plaquenil doesn't seem to give my partner any side effects, except maybe some stomach upset if they forget to take it with food. It can take up to 6 months to fully kick in, though.

My experience/battle with RA,post,"Let me first start off by saying, I am NOT a doctor nor is this medical advice. 

I am an army veteran and have been living a very fitness oriented lifestyle for 10+ years. I wasn’t always the healthiest when it came to diet and nutrition. I drank a lot of alcohol and dipped lots of chewing tobacco. Throughout my teens and whole time in the army, The only symptom I noticed was that my joints would pop and crack. I didn’t think anything of this. In 2020 (post military) I noticed I started to get really fatigue, constant chest pains, joint aches, stomach pains, you name it I had it. I brushed it off and just thought it was a symptom of all the drinking / stress / lack of sleep. In 2021 I went to a rheumatoid doctor and was diagnosed with RA and psoriatic arthritis. Honestly everything has gone down hill since then. Everything flares me up and I feel like I have the flu at least 2-3 weeks per month. The doctors pushed methotrexate and other immune suppressants on me and I tried it and I noticed nothing but more negative effects. I wanted to share with the community the only sequence of changes I have made in my life that actually made a difference, i am 100% sober, no drugs, no medications no nothing. 

To manage my symptoms I eat ONLY animal products (steak, chicken, salmon, eggs, and tuna), fruit, and sweet potatoes). Yes it’s boring but it’s better than being in pain 24/7. I do yoga and try to exercise 4x a week. I use 100% CBD flower. I would use THC but it causes my mental health problems to amplify. I don’t want my quality of life to be determined by a medication. The doctors gave up on me but I am a believer that diet and exercise can slow the progression of the disease. I hope this can help someone cause the only thing I’ve been shoved down my throat is medication after medication.

My experience/battle with RA,comment,"I work in orthopedics and I've seen patients like you come in. patients that got their diagnosis 5, 10, 15+ years ago but ""don't like taking medications"" so they change their diet, do yoga, take turmeric. every one of them has a story, something they've tried, a ""natural"" way to manage the disease. except that doesn't exist. they come in and say their joints really hurt, is there something we can do for them? then we take an X-ray and there's nothing left. their joints are destroyed. this is a merciless disease. I've seen a 40-something year old woman with no wrist joint left. her only surgical option was a fusion. this eliminates all planes of wrist motion, which didn't make much difference because she had barely any range of motion to begin with. the only thing she had left was a useless wrist and pain. surgery at least gave her relief of some of the pain.

rheumatoid arthritis means that your immune system not only attacks the things it should (viruses, bacteria, etc), it also attacks your own body. they only way to stop your immune system from attacking your body is by suppressing it, with *immunosuppressants*. when your body attacks your joints, it causes inflammation. by changing your diet, you're reducing the inflammation, but not the underlying cause. there is no food you could eat that would stop your immune system from attacking your body.

imagine this: you have mold in your home. it's starting to wear down the wood frame of your house as it spreads. you get to a point where you can't use the front door anymore because the frame has started to collapse. you decide to just use the back door to get in and out of the house, and that works okay for you. except it doesn't treat the mold or stop it from spreading. eventually the mold will find its way to the back door too, as well as the rest of the home, and destroy your home.

RA works similarly. you may not have much pain now because you're working to control your inflammation. but it's still destroying your body, and will catch up to you sooner or later. and once it does, the damage is already done. you can replace some joints, but not all, and a joint replacement is never as good as a native joint (when it is in good shape) because it doesn't have as good of a range of motion as a natural/native joint, and it doesn't replace any of the soft tissues around the joint which can be inflamed from the RA and will still hurt even after a replacement.

I can't make you take your meds. I can hope that you will listen to members here with more experience who are commenting, but at the end of the day your body is your own choice. but don't come here and try to talk other people into making a bad decision and not treating their disease. you're finding out that most of us in this sub do not tolerate that",5,ivmh5s5,,1667955790

That being said, if you’re just experiencing poor side effects and won’t take any medication, yeah I wouldn’t be surprised if they “gave up,” because RA is one of those things that will absolutely not get better unless you take immune suppressing medications. Doctors aren’t just pill-pushers though, and I’m really glad that diet is helping, OP, and adjusting diet CAN help with inflammation a little bit, but it’s more for non-immune related inflammation.

My experience/battle with RA,comment,"Thank you for commenting on this thread. 

I think patients get confused as to the role of medical personnel - we absolutely go to them for a number of things, diagnosis and treatment are the big ones in RA. 

At this time, the two main options for RA are pill medications and injectables (including infusions). 

Once we proceed through the stages of RA, this may also include surgery. 

While absolutely - if you are eating things that cause you inflammation, then by all means, NOT eating those things will make you feel better. 

I'm allergic to potatoes, corn, soy and eggs (yeah, my life sucks). Eating those things will not only land me sick in the bathroom for HOURS on end, it will raise my inflammation rates and PAIN. And generally, cause me to have an urticaria outbreak to go along with the RA Flare. 

But NOT eating them does not treat my RA. Because once more for the back, diet isn't treatment. 

Smoking is literally one of the worst things in the world you can do to your body. Drinking, too. Drinking SODA, as well. But giving ALL of those up will not treat or cure your RA. 

You're experiencing a temporary reduction in symptoms. These will return. And when they do, finding a rheumatologist once you have been refused by another can be very, very tough. Because rheumatology is a small group of doctors and they do tend to communicate.",6,ivlticd,,1667945655

Rheumatology is one of those specialties that is still pretty complex—a huge handful of autoimmune disorders still have no confirmed cause (aside from speculation and trend notation), and there are some rheumatic cases that are EXTREMELY rare, (my dad is one of those cases, he has microscopic Polyangiitis) so any successful, peer-reviewed treatment is going to be very much encouraged.

As smart and dedicated as you have to be to become a rheumatologist, even they don’t have very many options to give patients. I’ve worked with very passionate doctors that will run themselves into the ground (especially sub-specialists) with clinic, surgeries, and then spend hours researching conditions and performing studies that usually don’t come up with an easy, conclusive answer.

Rheumatology is one of the more mysterious specialties, because the body likes to freak the fuck out and self-destruct for so many reasons that it’s hard for anybody to put their finger on it.

My experience/battle with RA,comment,"Absolutely! A fair amount of insurance companies cover occupational or physical therapy to a degree from my understanding, and they can actually tailor certain assistive devices that can help with pain management (for example, a compression garment you can wear during flares to reduce pain and swelling). Using heat or ice on top of that can do a fair amount of help. 

Similarly, using kinesiology or KT tape can be really beneficial for swelling and pain relief! (You see it a lot in sports and sport recovery) they use a special cloth-like tape and apply it in certain patterns— and they have little waves on the adhesive side that lift the skin just enough to allow for some extra fluid drainage. They have specific kinds just for swelling, so I would definitely look into that if you can.

PT/OT is a much better ground between physician and homeo/naturopath. No offense to them, but I’ve heard that most naturopath services aren’t all that revolutionary when it comes to complex diseases and are sometimes even scams (even if they’re “certified”). OT/PT is extremely beneficial and has a lot of scientific data backing it up, and their jobs are to help assist with activities of daily living, so they’ll focus on that instead of med administration (but will probably still ENCOURAGE the use of medications, so keep that in mind).",2,iwdscta,,1668463542

Methotrexate is considered the “gold standard” because of its overall effectiveness in people (I’m not a medical professional, I was told this by my specialist).

Diagnosed with RA 6 months ago,comment,"If you read on the side effects it can seem scary as hell, I get it. Keep in mind they have to list every single thing that has happened, even if it was only for 0.001% 

Please do some reading on rheumatoid arthritis, the long term effects of untreated RA is so so much worse than any possible side effects. Re methotrexate especially, it’s given in much much higher doses for cancer and the horrible side effects is more common with those higher doses than the small ones we get. 

Take the meds, and if you notice any side effects you talk to your rheumatologist. There’s so many different drugs to treat RA so if you just communicate well with your rheumatologist then you will get on a regimen that is tolerable for you and that can slow, in some cases even basically putting the disease on pause. Almost everyone has to start on methotrexate though, it’s because of how effective it has been and how cheap it is. 

Just going to [drop an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/z81mp9/comment/iy9c7fl/) I’ve given in the past month 

> Sorry, but I’m going to be very blunt; seek proper diagnosis so you can get proper medical treatment. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, the pain you have now will be nothing compared to the pain you will be in if it’s left untreated and basically left to destroy your body. Diet, exercise, vitamin supplements, all kinds of non medical treatment treatments are great as extra things to do - but for rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease the only thing that will have an effect is medication.

> You might think that you can toughen out pain, might think you can get pain medication and just deal with it - pain is just a small piece of this disease, a really, really awful piece. The things you don’t see and don’t feel is what unchecked inflammation does to you internally. RA doesn’t discriminate joints, bones, soft tissue, organs or cardiovascular it damages it all. An anti inflammatory diet will not prevent inflammation from RA - yes it can help lessen, but not prevent.

> Sorry for painting such a grim picture, but it’s very important to get started on medication early. There’s lots of people who had their RA discovered early and got started on medication early and are basically living life as if they didn’t have RA. Then there’s those of us who weren’t lucky enough to get medical treatment early, we tend to have RA that the rheumatologists struggle to find medication to keep it in check other than steroids, and well long term steroids has its own set of issues.

The nausea, the dizzy spells, weakness and severe fatigue were not agreeing with me and the drug seemed to have worn off as I was getting constant flare ups. 
The specialist took me off the MTX injections and im due to start a different DMARD medication (Leflunemide) soon. 

So my advise to you is : listen to your body, document your side effects, how bad they are. Keep a list of everything but under NO circumstances stop taking your meds. That just causes more harm. Since your immune system is mistaking your healthy joints, ligaments and organs for diseases. 
Please stay safe and if the side effects get too rough, call your RA nurse team or special or doctor and request a review since your quality of life is important.",2,j1hiuiu,,1671882254

This is how well mtx works for me.

Diagnosed with RA 6 months ago,comment,"Echoing this. My doctor said the same thing. I’m only 24, but the sentiment still remains. That’s especially the case if you are still active. It can be hard to acknowledge that your RA is getting worse despite your best efforts, and for reassurance: if your doctor has diagnosed you with RA and what’s to move you to Methotrexate, it’s not aging. It’s RA. I was terrified to start medications for my RA myself because I already take a fair amount for other health issues and don’t like being reliant, since my finances are always tight, but everyone in this subreddit is right. Delaying it makes everything worse. RA discomfort and pain doesn’t pass like a headache does, as much as we wish it would. Good luck 💕 I’m thinking of you",5,j1ez16p,,1671827894

Diagnosed with RA 6 months ago,comment,"From my experience, with having four shots now and some reading up on the overall topic of RA, the shot isn’t faster then the pill. Both are effective, but the shots allow your body to absorb it easier and for it to spread faster versus it going through your stomach. The shots are more recommended by professionals because the symptoms are much less in comparison to the pill. From my understanding, it takes (with the shot) 3-6 weeks for your body to adjust and then the symptoms of the medication will lessen or go away, and it takes 3-6 months to feel full effectiveness. As I am still in the adjustment period, the effects of the medication in a positive light aren’t fully here yet, I’ve noticed small changes and I am hopeful for the future. 

If you do take this medication, save your stomach the trouble and take the shots. Also, you do need to take folic acid with methotrexate as methotrexate does push folic acid out of your liver. A 5mg tablet daily, or 2-3 times a week is what I’m taking and I find it to be enough. Also, methotrexate can cause mouth sores if you don’t take folic acid. 

One more thing! When I first started injections, I was told I would have to inject myself, but if you’re like me and can’t bring yourself to do it, a pharmacist will! However, they may turn you away if they have pregnant staff or the pharmacist is pregnant as methotrexate can cause defects to a baby during pregnancy. It’s more so a safety precaution more then anything.",2,j1fj9ns,,1671837012
Diagnosed with RA 6 months ago,comment,"My symptoms were totally out of control flaring. It was in my lungs and I had a hard time breathing, my feet always my most painful and the source of my initial diagnosis, were so sore it was miserable to sit even, I was just generally sick all over. Then my rheumy showed me a study that was 25 years old at the time out of the UK. They were tracking adults long term taking mtx for ra and they'd been found to be living longer. Like as long as their normal peers, thanks to methotrexate keeping inflammation lower in the organs. If you were diagnosed before about 2000  everything you read told you that your life expectancy was about 10 years less than your peers, but that has changed, first with mtx and later, I'm guessing with biologics. The 2 together are considered optimal. That was when I agreed to treatment of the max dose 25 mg. Sure click injection 1x weekly for 10 years now and I haven't looked back, except for that brief time in the summer when she dropped it to 20 and it took me a little over 1 month to feel bad. The drug works for me, like all of the others who commented.

Positivity about Methotrexate,post,"When I was first diagnosed with RA, I did a lot of research into the various treatment options, and found lots of negativity about Methotrexate and its side effects. So when my rheumatologist suggested this as my treatment plan, I was super anxious. But I followed their recommendation, and it's worked really well for me. So I thought I'd share my positive story of Methotrexate for anyone else doing their research.

Initially, I was put on 15mg oral Methotrexate a week. At first, I'll admit the side effects were bad. I took it on Saturday mornings, and had awful headaches for the rest of the day, and visual disturbances. At my next check in, my rheumatologist suggested taking it at night instead. It made the world of difference. I felt quite groggy on Sunday mornings, like a bit of a hangover, but it was manageable.

After some time, I had my dose increased to 20mg per week. I was nervous that the hungover feeling would become debilitating. My rheumatologist suggested splitting the dose, and doing 10mg on Saturday and 10mg on Wednesday. I do still feel a bit tired the next day, but overall its been absolutely fine.

When I was diagnosed, I read so many 'horror stories' about MX and was really really nervous about taking it. It took me a while to find the best way for me to take it, but I'm so glad to have persisted. I hope this can be reassuring to anyone else in a similar position.",18,15t13mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/15t13mf/positivity_about_methotrexate/,1692217818

I have a history of depression and been taking an SSRI for over 10 years but my mood has been very stable the last few years. 

This last year for me has been rough with illness, hospital stays, death and loss so I don’t know if it’s the fact that it’s Christmas and that time of year and I’m sad about those I’ve lost and won’t be able to celebrate with - if it’s the fact that I don’t feel well physically or if it’s the medication.

I just realized I’m vitamin deficient bc (probably) I’m not getting enough iron/b-12 and also (per the arthritis foundation’s website), inflammation can limit how well you absorb these minerals

I even asked my doc once if there was anything we could do and unfortunately he said that fatigue is something we just kinda have a deal with.

has anyone else experienced this symptom with RA?,comment,"Yes, I used to experience this on a daily basis when I was still working full-time. Except I felt that way all day, so I would have to go to my car and take a nap during lunch in order to have the energy to make it through the afternoon. And I would still sometimes doze off while driving, which of course made me a danger on the roads. I was taking Methotrexate for part of that time, and it wasn't doing me any good. I switched to Humira and started working from home, and those fatigue episodes started to fade. I have extremely low vitamin D levels, so I upped my daily dose to about 50,000 IU and the exhaustion has faded almost completely. But I'm retired now, so obviously my stress level is a lot lower than it used to be.

I will say, if I eat a lot of carbs I get those same episodes, so you might want to consider lowering the amount of carbs you eat each day. I honestly don't know if that's because of the RA or not, but I certainly never experienced that before my diagnosis.

Then that day it was the same but it was so bad that I wore the clothes I slept in because the extra effort to dress myself was too much. I went in and out of nausea and sleep on the car ride over, and then the guys wanted to get dinner. I absolutely could not. I had never been that tired in my life. But it was a type of tired that if I moved around I felt awful, like sick, nauseous, heart racing, anxiety, everything. So I told them I was so sorry but I couldn’t go. I slept and moped in the fetal position until they got back. Luckily that gave me enough energy to go to the show. Normally I would just cancel if I felt that shitty but these were super expensive tickets with a friend who had flown a ways to be with us. I ate some food and was able to keep my energy up for the show but the end of the night (3 hours later) I was hurting and back to being sick.

Methotrexate for RA,comment,"hi! first off, i know how hard and frustrating it can be when a doctor doesn't quite give you the information you need!

so i have been on methotrexate for 8 months now (as a weekly injection) and i have had a relatively easy time with it (compared to what i have read/heard from others). from my experience/knowledge, the injections tend to have fewer side effects than the oral form (taking it in a pill form can be harder on the stomach i think) and taking the folic acid will also lessen the side effects. for me, the first few doses were tough and i can only describe the feeling the next day after the dose as being hungover lol! after about the 10th dose, that hungover feeling the next day started getting less and less and i don't tend to experience any side effects from the mtx, which is to say that for me taking it got easier. 

also when i started on methotrexate and was doing my own research as well, it was easy for me to get caught up with reading the side effects that people who were taking methotrexate in high doses as a cancer treatment were experiencing and to think that those were the side effects that i would also experience. obviously, i am not sure of what dose you will be taking but when prescribed for RA it tends to be an amount that is significantly less than what is used in cancer treatments, so i that was helpful for me to keep in mind. 

this is just my experience but i hope maybe some of this helped you and i hope that starting methotrexate will go smoothly for you :)",10,jt6as25,,1690149588

Methotrexate for RA,comment,"Before my Dr prescribed MTX for me, he showed me the potential side effects slide on a PC to scare me (into properly progressing with RA diagnosis, being clear and being sure etc). A few horrible months later, by the time he was convinced I should start trying (after a proper course of trials, NSAIDs, Steroids, Ultrasound scans, a few weeks of pain) he showed the same side effects slide and told me its just about as long as acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol, paracetamol) and told me not to be overly worried.

Whatever does that mean -

I am now into my 4th full month of MTX and the pain is bearable, from 4-5 out of 10 before to 0-1-2 out of 10. 15mg / week.

I've gotten my normal life back, I just cannot do heavy work. I may have damaged joints or ligaments due to the prolonged, mild RA i've been having for 20 years.

I'm 40, Male, 65kg, 170cm.

I only recall having intense fatigue on my first dose of MTX, 10mg, on the 24th-48th hour after ingesting.

I highly suggest as healthy a lifestyle you can after this. Eat well, stay within the safe side of all foods, alcohol seems make me suffer more, sleep A LOT and sleep early, exercise.

My pain and mobility started getting a lot better after a couple of weeks, but the rheum thinks that this is more likely to be a delayed effect of the steroid shot, rather than the MTX kicking in.

Methotrexate for RA,comment,"I’ve been taking MTX since March. Started on 15 mg oral but didn’t tolerate it very well, as my GI system is finicky anyway and it was a bit unpleasant. After 2 months we switched to injections on Wednesday night. The side effects are a little nausea sometimes the day after and on Friday, usually I am more fatigued than usual and sometimes feel “washed out.” By Saturday most of the time I feel pretty well! This is a big change for me as I used to wake up in pain that would last for hours when I had a flare. I do take the folic acid every day, as well as hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine and low dose naltrexone.
My husband said just this morning that my hand joints look much improved and that confirmed what I was noticing. 

I don’t know if you’ve heard this, but some people swear by Robitussin DM to counter the nausea if it is troublesome. I’m not a physician, so I’m not recommending that but I have found it helps. Everyone is different so you have to be willing to talk to your doctor, read everything you can and be ok with the fact that MTX doesn’t cure RA but it does help many people!

The best thing someone told me is that MTX takes time to work but having a positive attitude and a willingness to figure out how to make it work for you, chances are you will be glad your doctor prescribed it for you. Despite the rocky start, I’m glad we stuck to this!

Methotrexate for RA,comment,"Honestly mine has been quite positive. I have found routine helps hugely in reducing side effects.

You should be asked to take regular blood tests once on it to check it's not adversely impacting your health, but just because it isn't harming you doesn't make some of the other side effects okay, they can be unpleasant. 

Mine started worse, feeling generally hung over and a bit nauseous for the whole day, but I'm now on week 16 I think and asides from a headache first thing and then a bit of lethargy on the night after, I am pretty much ok. I do suffer from fatigue, but that seems to be more about the arthritis than the medication from my research.

My routine is; drink plenty of water on the day you take it and the day after. I take mine on a Sunday night because I'd rather feel ill at work than on my weekend. I have a big carb based meal on Sunday about 7pm, an actamel at 10pm and I take my meds at 10.30. I take my folic acid at 10.30 on Monday night. I try to go straight to sleep so I sleep through most of the symptoms of taking it. I havent heard of anyone else taking actamels for the stomach but I thought it was worth a try and it seems to help. I also brush my teeth and mouthwash immediately after and I haven't suffered from any ulcers, so not sure if that works or is luck haha. 

The times I have deviated from routine are the times I have suffered more, i.e. if I take after only a light salad or am ill. Taking on a small cold or upset stomach is fine but my consultant advised to skip if feeling really unwell and I would second that having been through it. 

I really hope it works for you, feel free to ask if you have questions. For me it was about 3 weeks before I noticed anything, and then about 9 weeks in we upped the dose because I had stopped improving any further. I am now 2 weeks into Sulfasalazine on top of methotrexate to try and improve further still. Im far from perfect but the methotrexate helped give me my life back as before I was basically bed bound and now I am sore but able to walk my dog and move around.",2,jt6ax3p,,1690149649

Methotrexate for RA,comment,"I've taken Methotrexate since childhood, I'm actually going to right now, and for me the side effects have been difficult. I always felt really nauseated after taking it, I've tried both injections and pills several times, but it didn't help much until recently I got some tips which maybe you can ask your doctor about if it might help you too, though don't do anything before speaking to them of course.

1. Rather than taking the full dose from the get go as I've been trying prior, my doctor suggested that I start with three pills at first for a couple of weeks to get my body used to the medicine before adding one more until I reached the full dosage prescribed by the doctor.

2. I now take folic acid everyday to help with minimizing the nausea potentially caused by the medicine rather than just a day after taking Methrotrexat.

This has worked for me to a big degree and so a lot of times I don't even feel any nausea anymore aside from some occasions where it does come back but it's way different than how it used to be so I'm just really grateful for that. It's also highly individual as my grandfather takes Methrotrexat as well and he doesn't have any side effects whatsoever after taking folic acid.

Again though, this is a medicine that shouldn't be changed without first the consultation of your doctors so anyone reading this and dealing with nausea or stomach issues caused by Methrotrexat, always speak with your doctors first before changing dosage!",1,jt86w6q,,1690189061

Methotrexate for RA,comment,"I’m newly on MTX too! Besides pregnancy, my doctor said her most important note was extremely limited or preferably no alcohol.

I had some benefits from those meds, but after just a few weeks I started to see less swelling in bad joints and feel like I had more energy. I'm not saying everything was perfect!

Methotrexate and fatigue,post,"I see a rheumatologist for the first time this week. I of course have pain and stiffness and other physical symptoms, but the fatigue is horrendous. I need to sleep, like, 10 hours a day, and even then feel groggy and brain foggy and just really low energy all day long. I take naps on my office floor during my lunch break. I have a 2 year-old, and it's really hard to be my full self when I spend time with him because I know I'll be laid out the whole next day.

I think the plan is to start methotrexate very soon. I hear that also can knock people out. Is this going to make my energy worse?

Methotrexate and fatigue,comment,"I haven’t noticed much of anything with methotrexate.  Everyone is different, of course, in how their body reacts.  


The low energy and tired all the time and brain fog certainly are a huge issues. I also have fibromyalgia along with rheumatoid arthritis.   I do have my vitamin D and iron levels checked all the time.  And I believe with methotrexate folic acid is typically an additional supplement that you need to take when you’re on this prescription.

The only other thing I can think of with the energy, at least for me, I just have to make myself do things which sounds easy, but it’s like trying to move a mountain. 

Typically what I do to kind of trick myself into doing stuff.  I will start off very slow very gentle, yoga movements, and I focus on the areas that really hurt the most.  And I just start to move around gradually pushing my boundaries more and more until I can get out of the chair and get up and stand up and walk and move around.  

But if I wake up in the morning and think of all the things ahead of me that I want to do or need to do, that’s a sure fire thing that I’m probably not gonna be able to get out of bed   

So I guess I’m playing mind games with myself.  If I can slither myself over to my chair and take my meds and start with some really gentle yoga movements in my problem areas I eventually will be able to stand up and walk and move

How long until you noticed improvements?,post,"Hi all, I (28M) was recently diagnosed and started 15mg of methotrexate last night. Blessedly I am currently side effect free. 

I’ve been in minor pain for about 12 months but since January I’ve been really suffering; no grip strength and constant pain in swollen fingers, knees agony to stand up off chairs, elbows and shoulders never comfortable etc etc.

So, my questions are for those who went on methotrexate, how long did it take to start working for you? How much of your pain and symptoms has it gotten rid of? And also if you take you methotrexate of an evening, when is the optimal time the following day to take your folic acid? In the morning or exactly 24 hours later.

What should I expect on Methotrexate?,comment,"I'd say try to get the injectable if you can, because it seems that overall people have less side effects doing the injections. 

I started my injections this past December.

I only had side effects the next day if I had taken CBD on the same day as my injection-- so I just try to now avoid anything that could potentially interact poorly on the same day as my injection.

Initially, I would feel pretty fatigued the next day -- but it honestly doesn't affect me as much now (6 months on the medication). 

I am very good about taking my prescription folic acid every day (I also take a general multivitamin and iron supplement too), so I haven't experienced any hair loss. 

It's been very helpful for me to be on this medication and I'm glad I don't really experience many side effects. 

I recently moved and was able to physically keep up pretty well, which is encouraging for me as it shows that this medication is really helping me.

How long does it take for the effects of junky food to show up in your body?,post,"Hi y'all 👋🏽 I (40F) got diagnosed with RA about a month ago. I'm on methotrexate and starting to see some slight improvements so I'm optimistic about the future! I'm also grateful for all the advice, commentary, and anecdotes from this community that are getting me through it. 🥰

My question today is about food/diet. From my research, I've learned that certain foods can trigger inflammation or make it worse so I'm trying not to eat junk food. However, sometimes I'm craving the bad foods and I indulge, but I haven't been able to ascertain whether these foods are impacting me negatively. I haven't clocked any differences either way. 

What are your experiences when you eat poorly? Do you feel it a few hours later or the next day? What are the worst foods? Are there certain body parts affected more than others?

There is also tofu & eggs, both easy additions to a lot of meals. Bananas, green yogurt, dairy, and dark, leafy vegetables are rich in protein as well, and I always cook with a cast iron for that iron boost!

MTX is usually prescribed with a taper in, so you're probably only taking a small dose now, and will work up to a therapeutic dose over the next couple weeks. When you are at the therapeutic dose...

If your doctor didn't talk to you about how to take it, I suggest that you talk to them about it. A common recommendation is to take the pills in the evening, so you sleep through some of the side effects. Though now there's also recommendation now to split the dose, where you take half in the morning and have in the evening, and that seems to manage a fair amount of the nausea. Don't do this based on my recommendation, make sure you talk to your doctor about it and ensure they agree. 

Take it with the big glass of water, stay hydrated. I find the nausea worse if I don't eat, so I eat even when I am not hungry. ginger tea is your friend.",2,itunnx9,,1666790040

Methotrexate and alcohol,post,"Hi RA friends, I wanted to get other people's experiences regarding methotrexate and alcohol use (or lack thereof). I am going to bump up to 15mg per week starting next week. I have never been a big drinker. I take care of myself, and eat well. However, the idea of never being able to have a celebratory drink with friends while on vacation, or a glass of wine on a first date or something is really depressing to me and putting me in a funk. I have a tropical vacation planned, and I'm just bummed about it. My rheumatologist told me that no amount of alcohol can be condoned, and if I do decide to have a sparing drink, to run labs when I get back. I'm just trying to think about if I want to risk it or not. I'm soliciting thoughts, perspectives, and commiseration! :) Thank you!

P.S. If anyone cares to share their views on methotrexate vs biologics, I'm all ears. I haven't yet had a bad experience with it, but I'm on a low dose and the idea of a drug that isn't so potentially liver damaging is appealing. I know the biologics have their own set of challenges, though. Any experience or thoughts you care to share are very welcome!",11,138ym67,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/138ym67/methotrexate_and_alcohol/,1683314597
Methotrexate and alcohol,comment,"The thing about mtx and alcohol is a little special. I'm not a doctor or medical expert so definitely listen to your rheumy over people on the internet. As I understand it, mtx is metabolized in the liver. Since it's a once a week dose that's metabolized all at once, the liver takes a pretty substantial hit. Alcohol also taxes the liver. 

I was told that an occasional drink was fine if it's like one maybe two every once in a while. I was also advised not to drink anything within like 2 days of a dose. That said, I had one glass of wine once while on mtx and felt like absolute ass. To be fair, I did not tolerate mtx very well and it was also on a higher dose.",9,jj06gko,,1683316735
Methotrexate and alcohol,comment,"I've had RA for 20 years and was diagnosed at the age of 33. 
My first Rheumatologist told me not to drink alcohol with my 20mg Meth, so for 5 years I had not a drop, not even on Birthdays or Christmas.

Then I changed to a brilliant Rheumatologist and she told me that the ""occasional glass"" is just fine.
So now I have a couple of drinks (never more than 3) at special occasions or Bbqs. Maybe 4 or 5 times per year.

Everything in moderation.

PS: the person in a previous reply who drinks up to 8 drinks per week ... perhaps they should consider lowering the alcohol intake ... by a lot. 
I don't think regular drinking is advisable whilst on heavy, toxic medication. 

RA and the medication can affect liver and kidney function, which is why we need a monthly blood check. Regular alcohol is not recommended. At all.",6,jj2x2ql,,1683375780
Methotrexate and alcohol,comment,"I’m always wary to answer these because we all have individual health issues besides RA, and how we metabolize meds is likely different too. So your rheum is your best resource. My rheum discourages alcohol consumption but said I could have one drink on special occasions if I really wanted to and I didn’t have a special occasion every week. 😂

I inject 25mg of MTX a week and have never had liver values outside of normal range. Before or after MTX. I do try to time any drinking as far away from injection day as possible, but I don’t know enough about it to know if that makes a difference.

Edit to add I’ve continued the same dosage of MTX with the three different biologics I’ve been on. I also have no major side effects from MTX.",3,jj03d92,,1683315457
Methotrexate and alcohol,comment,"I've been on MTX for 12 years, both the injectable, and pills. I started with 40mg, and now I take 10mg weekly.  And for the entire time I've been on it, I've never not drank alcohol. And I have never had any abnormal liver function issues.

Let me state that I am not a heavy drinker, I maybe have 4-8 drinks a week.  I usually don't drink during the week, maybe a beer or a glass of wine with dinner.  On the weekends, Friday/Saturday, I'll have 2-3 drinks on both days.

There have been times during weddings,  week long all inclusive vacations where I'll drink like a college kid, and camping trips where I drink a lot more than normal.  And still no abnormal liver functions.  

I learned a tip early on, I take my MTX on Mondays.   When I am very unlikely to drink any alcohol for 2-3 days.  I call it Meth on Mondays, easy to remember,  and kinda fun to say.

Methotrexate and alcohol,comment,"I know this isn’t popular, but I used to drink the day before or 2 days after my injection. In the beginning, I also drank the day of if I really wanted. I really didn’t care about MTX or it holding me back from living life lol 

It didn’t do much, other than make the mtx hangover more pronounced. I wouldn’t recommend it, and of course listen to your Rheum - but drinking here or there didn’t make or break my liver. I’ve since cut down (just because of personal preference), and I’m currently obsessed with the Recess Mood drinks (no alcohol, just magnesium). 

If you’re really wanting to drink - I’d move your injection day to a day you’re less likely to drink (for me it’s Monday or Wednesday), and then you’ve spaced it out enough :)",3,jj0l1q0,,1683323088

Methotrexate and alcohol,comment,"I’ve been on MTX for 14 years. First rheumatologist said max one drink a month. And I did that for four years. My second rheumatologist and then third both said not to drink to excess. I’m not a big drinker, I typically drink one to two glasses of wine a couple of nights a week. I’ve never had any problem with liver tests. This disease takes a lot out of us and we have to make our own decisions about what kinds of risks we take. The “no alcohol and methotrexate” approach seems more prevalent with old-school US rheumatologists and much less of an issue for younger docs and academic specialists. It seems to not exist in Europe. The admonition there is to not drink to excess which they define as more than 14 drinks a week! I am a data person and constantly read RA studies. From a 2017 UK study: “In this study, we have demonstrated that the risk of transaminitis (liver damage) in patients with RA taking methotrexate does increase with increasing levels of alcohol consumption. However, the risk in those patients who consume 14 units or less of alcohol per week is no greater than those who do not drink alcohol” wrote William G Dixon, PhD and colleagues.”",2,jj4akbb,,1683398303

Methotrexate and alcohol,comment,"Same here. I have been on MTX for many years. I have .I did abstain from alcohol for awhile and then I didn't.  I have drank on and off and never had liver enzymes increased. I have a good liver. 

 I was put on MTX because my liver enzymes increased on on another medicine  Sulfasalazine. The pill MTX didn't help enough so I was put on injectable (0.7ml) and that helped. About 8 years my Rheumy added Humira. I am doing really well and this past year have been decreasing my MTX dose (0.3ml) now.

I tested positive for COVID on Thursday morning and I’m absolutely miserable. My doc told me to stop the methotrexate but safe to continue the hydroxychloroquine. I’ve got chills, fatigue, nausea, headache, loss of smell and taste, constant cold sweats, sore throat, body aches, and an awful cough.

It was back when they monoclonal antibodies were still effective and available, and I managed to get it the very next day.  It turned out to be a very mild sickness for me.

The second time, again, I tested positive the same day. I started feeling a little bad, got Paxlovid the same day, and it was very mild again.

Most recently, I felt like total crap and tested myself a number of times l, but it was negative each time.  On the 6th day, I suddenly lost my taste and smell, tested myself again, and it was positive.  But it was already beyond the point where Paxlovid would be able to help, so I just had to deal with it.  That time turned out a lot worse for me, and for a couple of days there, I was afraid I may end up needing to go to ER.

Since them I'm on methotrexate, prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, folic acid, omeprazole and ibuprofen. I have to take these everyday.
My pain is better but I'm still in pain most mornings, I keep having a reoccurring side effect of lip swelling in one area and it's horrible.
My self image is damaged due to past trauma and I literally can't take it anymore. 
If its not pain, it's swelling if it's not that then I'm nauseous or depressed. I cry constantly because my self image keeps getting worse, I can't exercise because of pain.
I live in the UK and the NHS & A&E Are shit!! I'm supposed to have health check ups which I'm not getting, I'm supposed to have physio therapy which I'm not getting, I'm supposed to see my specialist often when I've only seen him twice since I was diagnosed.

I have taken all of the drugs you are currently on (with the exception of omeprazole) and they made me sick—except ibuprofen.

I was fortunate that I had good insurance (I’m in the US) and my rheumatologist was very caring and offered every available treatment until we found something that worked. The methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine and folic acid all made me feel sick and really low. Prednisone can help during a major outbreak and while you are getting other meds on board but long term use is not recommended.

Ghost pipe(monotropa uniflora) is a plant that works like a dissociative. Separates you from the pain. Take in tincture form. Also look into ibuprofen and what it does to your body. For me it's the only OTC that does anything whatsoever to RA pain, but it's super bad to take long term so I try to use it as safely as possible. Also also, ice your veins.

The easy explanation is that they cost so much more but PBS rules are designed by doctors so maybe there's a bit of 'try a traditional treatment with known side effects first before hitting it with the new big guns.' They also have a rule about only getting 3 attempts with different biologics if they prove ineffective.   
Sounds like your insurance has similar rules.   
Certainly when I was diagnosed it was all about methotrexate being the wonder drug, with proven efficacy over decades. It just wasn't cutting it for me so they ended up adding hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide, with prednisone all through those 6 months, before going to adalimumab (which was an immediate game changer: just looking at reducing the others slowly now, hoping to drop them.  )

liver failure caused by meds,post,"Has anyone found their meds have caused their liver numbers to get really high? Iam currently on a cocktail of meds methotrexate, Lueflunomide, endep, duoloxatine went for a check up this week to be told my liver count is extremely high. The average person  sits at 40 mine is at 160. I've been taken off methotrexate and lueflunomide for a month to try and cleanse my liver. 

I eat a pretty balanced diet, have increased my water intake and started taking liver detox and milk thisiel tabs to try and help my liver recover. 

To say iam worried would be an understatement ive had RA for 10 years and learnt to make the most of the card I've been dealt with. But this is a new blow I have a family and husband and, need to be able to atleast function.

liver failure caused by meds,comment,"Enbrel caused acute injury and fibrosis for me after two years on other medications.  I work with a GI now and there’s no expectation that I can go back on any medications for RA for the foreseeable future.  I am a very uncommon case (my GI said they’ve only seen this twice in over 30 years) but at this point I’m just sticking to a healthy diet, exercising for 30 minutes 4-5 times a week, and do not take any medications outside of my anti-depressants and anxiety medication.  I use medical marijuana for pain and to help me sleep since my GI said it’s my only safe option as of now.  

It took 3.5 months to figure out what was happening after my ALT/AST came back elevated.  I went through a ton of blood work (where they found genetic hemochromatosis but no diabetes or high cholesterol/lipids), an ultrasound, a fibro scan, and then a biopsy before it was narrowed down.  All I can do now is hope me being healthy otherwise prevents it from getting worse/possibly reverses some of the damage.

How long did it take for Methotrexate to work?,comment,"Hard to say because I started methotrexate with regular, pretty high prednisone: after 8 weeks we added hydroxychloroquine, then 6 weeks later leflunomide. At around 5 months added Hadlima (adalumimab variant). Bang! Magic bullet.   
A week later I dialed down, and after 4 weeks, just stopped the prednisone. After 3 months I dumped the leflunomide.   
6 months into the biologic I've now reduced the methotrexate dose.   
Can't say yet whether methotrexate had no effect, but it definitely didn't do it by itself.  The rheumy doesn't want to stop it in one feel swoop in case it turns out that it is part of the solution.   
The only side effect of all of those was a little hair thinning that recovered once I was off the leflunomide.

Methotrexate Auto Injections,comment,"i was on both the pills and then the injections for about 3-4 years total (stopped methotrexate completely in 2021 despite effectiveness due to side effects). 

my dr said that side effects can be better for some people on injections, but i personally didn’t notice a difference. i found the injections to be more effective for me symptom-wise however. 
the side effects suck but the med works so it was a hard line to balance. i recommend asking your doctor about nausea meds (like zofran) if that is one of your side effects. 

as for needles - it does not come in an auto injector like humira or many other biologics, but the needle is actually much smaller and hurts less! i was taking humira and methotrexate at the same time, and methotrexate injections were less painful and i barely felt it.
 it was harder for me psychologically (both bc of side effects and bc i could see the needle) - i never actually gave myself the injection bc i didn’t like seeing the needle, i was 13-16 when taking it too, i think i would’ve become more comfortable to do it on my own now. i made my mom, (who is a nurse lol) do the injection for me.

As for your fear of needles, you won't even feel it imo, only the tip of the needle makes contact with your body (ps: I use a pen injection).

Hi everyone,post,"New here because reality has hit me like a ton of bricks this morning.  Long story, short - I realized there was an issue in February, started the process with my normally useless GP, travelled to see the specialist and have and alllll the testing done.  No surprise to get a positive diagnoses.  All in all, I’m a pragmatic person who “keeps moving forward”, so I know there’s a meltdown in here *somewhere* but I haven’t had it yet.  Today my rheumatologist’s nurse called to go over the pretests for meds (chest x-ray, standing orders for bloodwork) and it all went as I expected.  Since the idea of RA entered the picture, a lot of other puzzle pieces around autoimmune issues (from eczema to mouth issues, etc) are falling into place, so a sense of “okay, this makes sense, now we deal with it” is normal for me.

And yet…I can just feeeeeeel a total breakdown burbling up inside me.  I’m basically the one who keeps this household together - I have an adult kid who has horrific, undiagnosed chronic pain who I care for, and my husband who has debilitating, barely managed, vertigo (please don’t ask, yes, we’ve heard of the Epley Manoeuvre, and no it has not helped - this is more extreme), who I am care partner to.  I’m the only driver.  I’m the one who knows what’s in the fridge and cupboards and has a backup plan if my husband is too sick to eat.  I’m the one who has to know what’s going on with the pets.  My kid and their roommate live downstairs, and I *have* asked them for help more - including some of the housework.

But, I’ve just realized what the on-boarding for Methotrexate could entail, as far as the instruction “try not to plan anything for the first 24-48 hours as it could wipe you out” and I’m wondering where I’m going to draw from now because I’m already creatively hacking life to carve out moments of sanity as it is.

I’m honestly afraid to read more about RA because being fore-armed doesn’t sound like it’s going to make me feel more in control.  

I really thought I could take this on, like I do everything, but this bubble of panic doesn’t want to be pushed down and I’m a wreck.",12,1609v59,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/1609v59/hi_everyone/,1692901342

(Also, I kind of enjoy having an excuse to veg on the couch guilt-free every week. Make the experience a positive!) Not everyone has the bad side effects, we just hear about those more because no one posts just to say ""everything is fine.""

Hi everyone,comment,"It's very scary when you're first diagnosed.   Over time, you begin to realize that this is manageable,  and you can do this. If you're lucky like I am, an early diagnosis before any severe joint damage can lead to a reasonably comfortable life. There are uncomfortable days and problems that lead to some limitations,  but the better you take care of yourself,  the better your outcome will be.

Some unsolicited advice to the newcomer,

It is absolutely mandatory to maintain a healthy weight.  The heavier you are, the more affected your joints and organs will be.

Prioritize sleep and rest. It's your best friend.

Eat a very clean and healthy diet. The cleaner the better.  I try to live by the 80/20 rule.  80% of what I eat is clean, preservative free, unprocessed food.  20% can be a little bit unhealthy.  Limit fried foods, chips, refined sugars, shitty carbs, and anything with preservatives. 

Drink as little alcohol as possible,  I've had vacation weeks where I party like a college kid, but for the moat part it's no more 4-6 drinks a week.

Take all the vitamins and supplements you can.  I can't list all the supplements I take, but a little research will help you with that.

Exercise exercise exercise.   Low resistance training, yoga,  pilates, swimming, walking, whatever works for you.  But move your body.

You have a lot on your plate, caring for others in the way that you do, but you have to get them on board to help you out.  It will soon become unsustainable for you to run the household and take care of yourself in the way you need without help.  Don't be afraid to ask for help, and don't be afraid to say no.

Limit stress as much as you can.  It's difficult, but you have to figure it out.  

I'm Canadian,  and weed is legal here, but Marijuana and CBD are amazing for RA.  I regularly take edibles and high doses of CBD.  It helps me sleep and relax, which helps me feel better tomorrow. 

Take your methotrexate the day before your easiest day of the week.  For me it's Monday,  Meth on Monday,  and I never forget.  When I was doing injectables, the side effects ruined my next day, but I now take a small maintenance dose pill once a week of 10mg, and I don't notice it.  At first they prescribe you a much higher dose to get it under control, and it's honestly awful.  

I apologize for the wall of unsolicited text.  But if somebody had spoken to me in a way I just did to you, I feel that the first 3 years of me fighting this would have gone alot smoother.   It's rough and scary at first.",11,jxlrb6m,,1692909762
Hi everyone,comment,"First, I want to say I’m so sorry you’re going through this. You e found a great group here. Second, it’s perfectly normal to break down (and more than once). You’re going to be grieving - grieving your health, some of your independence, the life you thought you were going to have, etc. This diagnosis doesn’t mean you’ll never be able to do anything again. There’s definitely adjustment time, med changes, adjustments to life. Do you have a support system of your own that is outside of the household? Being more mindful of your body and what it needs is going to be very important, so if you’re able to get help on your “off” days, that will be super helpful.

Hi everyone,comment,"Hi,


I haven’t had any side effects from methotrexate except maybe a bit of nausea, but I had that before. I don’t feel bad the next day!


I’m currently on methotrexate, Orencia, plaquenil, and folic acid for my RA. And the benefits have been substantial! 


It’s also been nice finally being able to connect the dots! Like “oh! All that crap is autoimmune?!” so I get the relief aspect haha


Grieving also happens for me. It comes in waves. I’m 26 now, diagnosed at 24(?) with RA after “undifferentiated connective tissue disease” diagnosis since I was 16. Other health issues have come up and I’ve been on disability since I was 21. Seeing everyone I know and graduated college with advancing in life and doing all the things while I’m stuck in a loop of managing my health… it sucks and there are days it’s hard to not constantly grieve the life I thought I’d have. 


I’m also a “keep going” person and very practical most of the time, but feeling waves of grief coming and letting them happen is important. Get the emotions out when you can or you won’t have a say as to when they come out lol",4,jxmy4dq,,1692927459
Hi everyone,comment,"It’s absolutely ok to process your feelings (glad to see you’re thinking about going back to therapy)! This is tough and scary!! I will say, it sounds like you’re used to hard stuff and familiar with chronic illness, so although you may find the symptoms and side effects challenging, I don’t think you’ll be completely overwhelmed. RA is my 5th chronic illness diagnosis, and, honestly, it’s challenging but not that bad. I think of it as, if this is your first brush with illness, then it’s probably absolutely terrifying and hard. Like going from 9 hours of sleep every night to having a newborn. But as you experience the hardships, you level up in your tolerance to them. Your life has leveled you up already, and you are going to be able to take this on! You also got your diagnosis super fast, so you will hopefully have the benefit of early treatment!!

Sending lots of good thoughts for you!!",4,jxled0s,,1692904944

Starting methotrexate next week,comment,"I, and many others on this subReddit are or have been on methotrexate for years and have found it to be effective with minimal side effects. Methotrexate can cause nausea after taking it, and taking it in the evening before bed can be helpful. Also make sure your doctor discusses taking a folic acid supplement with you. Everyone's experience is different, if you have bothersome side effects let your doctor know, there are other medications to try. Methotrexate is usually the first one on the list that doctors prescribe, insurance expects it as it is one of the oldest, least expensive effective meds. I was on it for several years and it worked well for me, it became less effective as time went on so I was switched to biologics.

So my Dr switched me to the injection and told me to double up on my Levomefolic acid(folic acid).

Diagnosed with seronegative RA but something still feels off…,post,"Hello everyone i am F26 and i have been recently diagnosed with seronegative RA. My symptoms weren’t gradual and have no family history of RA . I just woke up one day with a sore arm and never went away for 2 years. 
My main pain area is my right arm and hand ( including fingers) and I seem to feel better if i do not use my right hand . In the case that i do use it i suffer for about a week until it calms down. All my blood tests are negative . Anything worth nothing in my Mri , EMG , EGG , and ultrasound , is flattening of the carpal tunnel , synovial hypertrophy ligament subluxation and an old sprain to one of the main ligaments with some fluid between joints. 
I have heard that synovial hypertrophy is a sign of RA but in healthy individuals  it is also stated on google that it could be overuse. 
I’m stiff in the morning on some days not so much on others and i don’t need much effort  to unbend my fingers . Mornings aren’t particularly worse than any other time of the day .
Even though i have been on methotrexate for a month now something in my head tells me “ this is not it , it is more overuse related“ 

My pain feels like muscles being pulled and peeled in opposite directions if that makes any sense. Typing and writing are a nightmare . My fingers do turn red when they are warm at times but no swelling or deformation . Also been diagnosed with raynaud .  My knees and toes also turn red with physical activity but they don’r hurt. Only my right arm does . Some specific points hurt as well like under my elbow and on top of my clavicle. My forearm feels tight and like there knots in there. The week following my first symptom i over used my hand with no rest. 
It is only my right arm .

Diagnosed with seronegative RA but something still feels off…,comment,"It sounds like you have several comorbidities to SNRA (I have it, too). The swollen joints are inflammation, of course. It's very common to have one or a few specifically worse joints, especially in the beginning stages. Did the rheumy discuss what stage of RA you are in with you?

OA (osteoarthritis) does not answer the rest of your symptoms, however. You can of course, have RA and OA at the same time. Also, from your own symptoms - you are NOT a healthy individual. 

The ""muscles being pulled and peeled in opposite directions"" is very, very common. Full body, flu-like aches is another phrase. I generally describe mine as a puppet put together by an insane puppeteer. The swelling makes our ligaments and muscles work harder and often are also being affected by inflammation, as well.

Diagnosed with seronegative RA but something still feels off…,comment,"I don’t have anything meaningful to add to this, but I was also diagnosed with seronegative RA and Raynaud’s/sjogrens despite bloodwork and testing mostly being normal (only screens that came back posi were ANA, CRP elevated slightly and elevated beta 2 globulin) and have struggled to accept that. I also didn’t have a history of RA- not a single person in my family had any form of arthritis, and I also have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, so just always assumed the pain was coming from that. I found it helpful to seek out a second opinion if that is an option for you, and my rheum also told me it’s important to understand that when RA is starting out it can take a while to manifest fully. I hope you can get some answers and treatment that help with the pain you’re experiencing. Have you gone for nerve conduction test? I had one done and they found that some of my reflexes were dulled and that I had peripheral neuropathy which was causing the arm pain, and that aided in the diagnosis.

Diagnosed with seronegative RA but something still feels off…,comment,"RA is weird. I have SNRA and truthfully my situation was pretty similar, except I have a family history of autoimmune disorders. 

Mine started rather suddenly and actually didn’t start with pain at all. I had some super heavy brain fog for about a year and got diagnosed with ADHD and was put on Adderall. Then I was tired all the time. The first sign I had that something was WRONG wrong was when my knuckles started turning red like you mentioned. I had no pain at all when they became red. Then I woke up and one finger felt like it needed to be popped but wouldn’t. Over the course of the week it got painful and stiff, and from that point forward i got some more classic RA symptoms.

My rheumatologist told me that the main reason it takes so long for autoimmune disorders to be diagnosed is that even though there usually is a guideline for diagnosis, the body is fucking weird and these diseases can vary wildly in terms of symptoms, damage, disability, etc. it could be that you’re very early-stage, like me. Whether or not it’s disabling in the classic sense, if a doctor confirms that you have RA, they have reason to believe it, even if your labs say otherwise. My rheumatologist told me that red knuckles are usually pretty tell-tale for an autoimmune problem, and although it’s not TEXTBOOK, me and you both have similarities in symptoms",2,ixt2igj,,1669431854

Diagnosed with seronegative RA but something still feels off…,comment,"I notice a bit of phrasing in your post and comments, so I want to go over a few things.

No erosion - erosion is found in Stage 2, 3 & 4.

No significant synovitis - Synovitis is present, however, as you note.

No inflammatory arthritis - IA is a GROUP of autoimmune rheumatoid conditions, such as Lupus SLE, Ankylosing spondylitis, Gout & RA. Ultrasound does not always pick up early stage IA, and generally only does so in comparing scans over time from the studies I've been able to read on this (2013-2015, so may be somewhat out of date). The use of the phrase ""might be helpful"" seems a tad lackluster, in using US as a diagnostic screening in early stages.

So let's review RA stages:

Stage I: Synovitis

Stage 1 is early-stage RA. Many people feel joint pain, stiffness, or swelling. During stage 1, there’s inflammation inside the joint. The tissue in the joint swells up. For example, when there is stage 1 RA in the hands, a person may feel stiffness and pain in the finger joints and knuckles. These sensations can usually disappear with movement.

Stage II: Pannus

Stage 2 is moderate-stage RA. In this stage, the synovium’s inflammation causes damage to the joint cartilage and bone. Cartilage is the tissue that covers the end of bones at the joint site. The bone next to where cartilage ends in the joint is the first area that experiences damage due to RA.

When people have cartilage damage, they may experience pain and loss of mobility. The range of motion in the joints may become limited. For example, RA in the hands may show up in the form of stiffness and difficulty bending the fingers.

Stage III: Fibrous Ankylosis

Once RA progresses to stage 3, experts consider it severe. At this point, the damage extends to the cartilage, and bone destruction progresses. Since the cushion between bones wears away, the bones rub together.

There may be more pain and swelling. Some people may experience muscle weakness and more mobility loss.

The bones can experience damage (erosion), and some changes in formation may occur. Examples, which may be permanent, include twisted fingers and thickened knuckles. Other symptoms may include compressed tendons at the wrist, with symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome or tendon rupture.

Stage IV: Bony Ankylosis

At stage 4, there’s no longer inflammation in the joint. This is end-stage RA, when joints no longer work as they should.

In end-stage RA, people may still experience pain, swelling, stiffness, and mobility loss. There may be lower muscle strength. The joints may experience destruction, and the bones may fuse (ankylosis).

As to a few other things:

Ligament subluxation is VERY common in RA - happening in 70% of cases. Scattered fluid between joints and synovial thickening is likewise common.",2,ixrs5m7,,1669408881

Tips for Humira?,comment,"I take it out of the fridge about 30 minutes to 1 hour before I inject it. I find that if it's still cold the injection is more painful. I inject it about an inch away from my belly button, because that's the location on my stomach where I have the most fat, and so I don't tend to bleed very much if at all when I inject there. If I go farther away from my belly button and get into the muscle, I tend to bleed and bruise.

I use the humira auto injector, which I find to be infinitely easier than when I was self-injecting Methotrexate using a regular needle. I would double check with your rheumatologist as to whether there would be side effects of taking both medications on the same night, but when I was taking two different medications once a week I used them about three or four days apart, just to be safe.

Tips for Humira?,comment,"Thanks for the insight! I take my methotrexate orally once a week so don’t have to worry about hitting the same spot back to back, but still might space it out one day. My doctor specifically recommended I take methotrexate mid week so if I want to have a little bit of alcohol on the weekends, the mtx would have been in my system long enough to not cause major side effects from the alcohol. She didn’t mention anything about the humira so I guess it is slightly different in terms of side effects, and don’t have to worry as much about the day of the week I take it as long as I’m consistent",1,ivy8eym,,1668177303

Tips for Humira?,comment,"It doesn't sting anymore, they took out the stingy bit. It's actually hard for me to tell if it went in now with the autopens. I kinda wish there was just a little sting to let you know you did it.

Personally I've seen no difference leaving it out longer. It's room temperature pretty quick. It's not even that much worse done cold, which I did by accident once when restarting after a few months. Don't recommend.

It takes a few months to work. Be patient. When you are healthy again, still mind your boundaries. You can still overextend and cause inflammation. 

Shot can make you hungover for a day, so take the shot a few hours before bed and sleep through most of it.

Don't drink often or much, especially the days before and after your shot. 

Shot can actually be room temp for a while before going bad, don't stress about moving them but do move them with ice packs. 

Ashwaghanda and reishi tea if you're into herbs. Make a few gallons, throw em in the fridge, and drink it often to rebalance some stuff the shots fuck up. 

Good luck!",2,iw6yqwn,,1668344413
"Newly diagnosed, seronegative 35/m",post,"Hello all,

Just got diagnosed today. Been dealing with pain/swelling/fatigue for years, but this summer I had a big flare up that prevented me from walking. My feet blew up like balloons and my hands weren't far behind. Pain was in the ankles, knees, wrists, and small joints of both hands.

4 days into Prednisone I felt better than I have in probably 10 years. One tapered off, back to constant nagging pain.

Today I got the diagnosis and a prescription for methotrexate and folic acid.

Looking forward to browsing this sub and seeing how people deal with similar cases.",12,16pk2b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16pk2b4/newly_diagnosed_seronegative_35m/,1695413404

Also, the folic acid does nothing for my fatigue. I have just resigned myself to going to bed early and getting 10+ hours of sleep.

"Newly diagnosed, seronegative 35/m",comment,"I have Seronegative RA.  I'm on Orencia infusion, plaquenil and 2mg of prednisone.

Luckily since I've been on biologics my crp and esr have been totally normal and that's going on 7 years.  Before that the levels were over 10.  I went on prednisone 3 years ago due to stubborn swelling in my hands and feet and it took this long to get down to 2mg.  For some reason my symptoms are extremely responsive to steroids.  But I now have osteopenia and cannot be on them really.  Ugh it turns into a big mess.

"Newly diagnosed, seronegative 35/m",comment,"Meh, they are tiny pills.  The fact that something cheap and easy as methotrexate works on me (and my liver doesn't seem to mind) is enough for me to be happy.   

My fatigue seems to be different than others. I have maybe 1 or 2 days near the end where its not as pronounced. So I take my pills on Sunday and I may have a Friday or Saturday evening where I am not asleep at 7PM.  The important thing is to try new approaches. If a drug does not seem to be doing much, tell your doctor.  Switch things up until you find what works for you. This thing has so much randomness.  You just have to keep looking at it as an ongoing fight.

Had my first rheum appointment,post,Hello! Today I (finally) had my first rheum appointment and he confirmed I have some sort of inflammatory arthritis but is sending me for more tests to try to confirm which type. What is scaring me is his has prescribed methotrexate. Me and my boyfriend have already discussed and I won’t start taking it until the new year because I want to enjoy my holidays but what I’m sort of concerned about is what it may do to my liver. I am 30 and have quite enjoyed drinking throughout my life so I’m scared that has already affected me and that this medication may escalate what I have already done. Honestly today was too much information for me to even think about this to ask him since I was just trying to not cry about not being to continue to try for a baby. Just wondering if there were any fellow party people who took methotrexate and were okay or not? I plan to stop drinking when I start the medication but just worried I already messed up my liver already.,6,zhkikr,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/zhkikr/had_my_first_rheum_appointment/,1670651923
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"I am in (almost) the same boat as you. I just had my first rheum appt yesterday, I'm 30F and was prescribed MTX + folic acid as well. The pharmacy hasn't filled my script yet so I haven't taken my first dose but I will most likely take it next Friday night. 

My only difference is I have 2 kids. My doctor asked quite a few times if I had plans to have any more (I don't) but he wasn't going to prescribe MTX if that was the case. 

If having a baby is 100% what you have planned for your near future, I would let your doc know. Mine mentioned they recommend 6 months - a year of being off MTX before trying to conceive.

And sidenote for hair loss, I had REALLY BAD postpartum hair loss with my youngest and rosemary water was a cheap homemade miracle at bringing my hair back to life. So that'll be in my plans when I start this drug as well!",3,izne0jl,,1670673177
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"My two cents…and a lot of questions. 

Before you start or do anything, I recommend you and your partner have a conversation about children. You could discuss the prioritization of life choices. 

Is it best to have a child before you start any medication to control your inflammation? You could go into remission during pregnancy. It can also get worse after the baby is born. 

If you have a child, is your partner able to care for a baby and you if you are sick? Do you have family and friends who can help?

Can both of you be 100% transparent when it comes to honesty about everything or the ability to talk so everyone’s needs are met?
Consider genetic testing before trying to conceive so you give your baby a healthy start. Also, you should get a check up to make sure you are healthy for a pregnancy. *I recently learned I would have been on bed restriction my whole pregnancy if I were pregnant*

What changes are need if both of you stop or continue social drinking? Is your partner willing to quit while you’re pregnant? It can be difficult if you’re the only one not drinking. 

Finally, what does life look like if you start meds. You can drink while on methotrexate but it makes your meds less effective. I drank and didn’t have issues but now I quit due to the types of meds I’m on now. 

Don’t worry about your liver yet. The blood work will let your doctor know. 

I wish you the best.",2,izoqf6o,,1670696811
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"I've been on MTX on and off for years. Never had a problem with casual drinking. Side effects were minimal, while the med helped tremendously. No issue with liver or any other organ. 

Also, as an aside - being a party person with RA/IA is likely not going to be a lifestyle you can keep up with long term. Alcohol is one of the more damaging things overall for us, as well as cigarettes.",0,izntfo1,,1670682668
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"Congrats on making it to your first appointment, I hope you had a good experience with your new doctor, because you will see them a LOT!

 I was also put on MXT when first diagnosed and I was petrified based on all that I had read. I actually put off my first dose for close to two months because I was finishing my degree and I was afraid the side affects would prevent me from getting everything done, so I completely understand. It turns out I have had almost no side effects. He did prescribe folic acid to take every day and that is supposed to help with many of the symptoms. I also make my Saturday night a carb heavy night, so it’s usually pasta of some sort, also supposed to help prevent nausea, (this could completely be a placebo for myself now, but it’s become tradition and I’m not messing with it). I did experience some hair loss, but at my next appointment he double my folic acid and now that’s no longer an issue.

As to your liver, I am unsure of what the ramifications would be. I have to get a full lab panel done every 2-3 months while I’m on the MXT to watch for affects but it seems I’m doing okay. Know that they will watch for changes and catch it pretty quickly if anything is awry. Good luck to you and I hope things progress smoothly!",1,izmpcec,,1670652661
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,Hey I’ve been on MTX since 2014 and I’d say I’m the first few years of being on it I had a lot more nights out drinking (though not a lot because I am not a huge drinker anyway) and I’ve drank occasionally the whole time on it without any issues whatsoever. Has your rheum prescribed folic acid too? You’ll also be required to get regular blood tests to monitor your liver so you should be ok. I’m sure they also test your liver function before prescribing so they’ll be able to check to see if it’s in a position for you to be on MTX at all. I think you’ll be okay!!,1,izmpfpn,,1670652725

Had my first rheum appointment,comment,When you start methotrexate your bloodwork is very closely monitored so that high liver enzymes are addressed immediately.

Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"I had fatigue and mild nausea for a day or two after my MTX when I started. This got better after a few weeks. I’ve now worked up to a high injectable dose and have no side effects. No hair loss. Blood work less frequently because I’ve been stable on it so long — so every 2-3 months. Had minor sore develop on side of my tongue. Rheum immediately increased my folic acid and it’s been smooth sailing ever since. 

I don’t drink much on it. My rheum told me a drink on special occasions was okay as long as my blood work has been good. I did drink a little more than that when on vacation this summer and thankfully my labs stayed good but I definitely don’t make a habit of it. I find alcohol interfere with the quality of my sleep and not getting good sleep definitely increases my RA symptoms.

Edit to add I wasn’t a big drinker in the past but when I did drink I was kind of a binge drinker. I’m in my fifties and liver numbers are always normal. Try not to worry about what you’ve done in the past. They’ll monitor your numbers.",1,izofrye,,1670692500
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"I was on mtx for several years and did well and had no issues with hair loss/nausea etc. I switched to biologics (Enbrel/Humira/now on Rinvoq and doing very well) after a few years as the mtx wasn't working well for me and my liver enzymes started to go up. I've never been a heavy drinker but enjoy a glass of wine occasionally. I usually took my mtx before bedtime in case of side effects, but never had a problem. If mtx doesn't work for you or you are having unpleasant side effects there are numerous other meds your Rheumatologist can prescribe. If you want to get pregnant make sure you tell your Rheumatologist, some of the RA meds are safe to take while pregnant.  I agree with a previous poster to make sure your health is stable and your SO knows the unpredictability of this disease - you don't want to have a baby with someone who will not be supportive through the ups and downs you may have. Best of luck to you!",1,izr28s4,,1670735873
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"My doctor started me on hydroxychloroquine aka Plaquenil because he said out of all the meds they have to treat RA, it has the least side effects and the safest. If you are really worried, ask if you start on that instead. Learning what you can about meds on your own can be very helpful because you can walk in with knowledge and ask questions. “Hey, so I know this one is an option, is there a reason why you didn’t choose that one? From what I have read/heard I would be a lot more comfortable with those potential side effects.”

That stopped being enough for me so now I am also on another one. But he would not prescribe me anything that could be harmful to a baby because I am child bearing age. Even though I have no intention on having kids.

Talk to him again about your concerns about wanting kids. There are like 24 medications to choose from. Each doctor usually has their favorite or their standard, but can always choose something else that is more appropriate for you",1,j11wh8w,,1671586915
Had my first rheum appointment,comment,"These are great questions. 

To add to this—if you have a baby, OP, what if your hands hurt to the point you can’t carry them some days? Or you don’t have the dexterity to feed them or change them? I think it is important to discuss this with your doctor and partner. You need a realistic plan in case things do become unmanageable. Not that they will! You may become symptom free on the right meds, and maybe even ones that don’t affect pregnancies! But it sounds like you need more information before making a decision like that—to have or not to have kids.",1,j11xf20,,1671587346

Had my first rheum appointment,comment,Yes I was prescribed folic acid with it. I did have regular blood work done dec of last year so I am hoping that he looked at that prior to prescribing. I am familiar with the healthcare system where I live (Canada) since I work in it and I know these things get missed because the public system is over run so I am just worried he didn’t actually look at my previous blood work besides the tests for autoimmune stuff.

"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",post,"I've been pretty lucky, the other travel-related questions I've been reading up on here mostly have to do with pain relief, but I've been doing well enough recently that that's not my main concern, it's more about the risk of covid. I'll be going to a developing country from the US, and they don't have some of the more recent very effective treatments the US now has.

Background: I'm 37 and have had another autoimmune condition, lichen planus, for a couple of years ago, and was taking methotrexate for it, and then was diagnosed with RA and Sjogren's earlier this year when some of my joints starting hurting terribly. For all three conditions now, I *only* take 400mg of hydroxychloroquine daily, and while the dryness and thirst and itchiness and twinging joints and tiredness still aren't great, they're manageable. 

I'm also overweight and have had mild asthma since childhood, except some years back when I had pneumonia and it combined with the asthma to make it impossible to breath. But aside from that, it's been fine!

I'm more worried about what a long journey I have coming up (three different flights and stopovers adding up to about 24 hours of travel, one specific flight being a 13 hour non-stopper) and the number of people I'll be exposed to and the amount of time around them. I live alone and mostly work from home so I've been able to stay mostly isolated these last few years, and I mask up outside, and am planning to for most of the trip but I'll have to eat and I'll still be in those planes and airports with a bunch of people, mask or not.

I've tried to read up on the risk of RA and covid, but a lot of what's been said about more severe cases seems to narrow in on immunocompromised systems, especially as a result of taking certain meds, which from what I can glean, hydroxychloroquine isn't one of? But looking hydroxychloroquine and covid of course gives you just results on all those articles and studies on how effective it is at treating it after... you know. Other reports of more danger for RA patients mention having particularly bad/advanced cases which I would say I don't have?

"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",comment,"Personally, I’d be more worried about flaring with all of the travel than COVID at this point in time.  I’m on Enbrel, have been fully vaccinated including the updated boosters, and I’m not terribly concerned with COVID at this point given the availability of treatments and how much more we know about treating it now.  My doctor has been encouraging patients to live their lives as normally as they feel comfortable with since early summer.

"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",comment,"I'm a walking collection of autoimmune diseases, so I did extensive research when covid hit. If you are worried about catching Covid, traveling by airplane is the safest. The way they keep the cabin pressure is constant airflow. They have vents over every seat, so every passenger is breathing fresh air. Unless the person directly next to you is both experiencing symptoms and coughing in your face, you should be fine. The layovers inside the airport is where you will be the most exposed. If you can, upgrade your mask to n95. I get mine from projectn95.org so I know that they are legit.",4,ivew8bv,,1667829101
"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",comment,"While hydroxychloroquine does lower your immune response, it doesn't do it as drastically as, say, Humira does. I was on hydroxychloroquine for the first year of COVID and I was advised not to travel ANYWHERE because the pandemic was much more severe in 2020. But it's when I started Humira that my rheumatologist advised me to avoid airplane travel whenever possible specifically because of my RA and medication regimen. I think at my last checkup my immune response was around 20%, so even though COVID numbers are very low in my current location I still don't go anywhere where there's crowds excepting grocery stores, and I try to go shopping in the middle of the day when most people are at work. I also still wear a mask, and I plan to for the rest of my life.

I would check with your rheumatologist but honestly, like the other poster said I would be more concerned about a flare up given the stress of travel. One reason I don't plan on taking an airline trip in at least the next few years is the fact that I get so stressed out from travel through airports. I experience less stress on an 18-hour drive than I do a 2-3 hour flight because of the airport, not because of the flight itself. I guess the question is how well you travel. If you're like me and it's more of a challenge, you may find it more difficult. 

Perhaps part of the solution would be to build in a day upon your arrival where you can simply rest, whether at your hotel or whatever your accommodation is, where you don't have to go anywhere except maybe for food. One day to unpack, cope with jet lag, and sleep in a proper bed maybe enough to help you work through any flare up. And, of course, masking up for the entire trip from departure airport until you reach the final location.",3,ivdgwvs,,1667792860
"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",comment,"I've been on hydroxychloroquine for over 2 years. I got Covid for the first time in August and was able to get Paxlovid within the first 24 hrs. It helped me recover much faster, but the symptoms were still hell before they got better. The body/joint pain was so intense -- I honestly think that was the worst symptom for me. I couldn't get comfortable or be still because it was so bad-- it caused me a lot of mental distress because of this. Very very difficult time falling asleep (I had to take sleep meds to knock me out). Just awful. 

I've now been experiencing a long flare up ever since recovering. No new symptoms that would make me think there are new ""long COVID"" issues, but I haven't felt this bad of a flare up for this long since before I got diagnosed 😭 it really, really sucks. 

As others have said, it's technically an immunosuppressant-- but it's not doing the same suppressing of your immune system as something like methotrexate or steroids would.

Still, I can say as someone who recently went through it-- it's not a fun virus for those with health issues to deal with, even if you avoid being hospitalized. 

My advice would be to see if you can get some Paxlovid to take with you at all. It's really the only thing that helped me and I would not want to experience COVID without having some type of treatment like that available. 

When I've traveled by plane in the past year or so, I've worn an N95 mask and don't take it off for any reason. Now my flights have been 2-3 hrs, so it's a bit easier to pull off in that situation... But still, I'd just suggest you try everything in your power to lessen your exposure as best as you can.",3,ivdqhto,,1667798251

"newly diagnosed, med questions",post,"hello! i just turned 24 (f) and was finally diagnosed with RA after 6 months of pain in nearly every joint in my body. my rheumatologist had me on prednisone the last few weeks while we were waiting for my results to come back but i only have a few days left and he wants me to start methotrexate which i’m super nervous about. the side effects sounds so scary! i’m a barista and can’t afford to not work but before the prednisone i could barely move and i’m worried the methotrexate isn’t going to help for a few months. i told my pcp about my fear taking the methotrexate and he gave me meloxicam to try first. has anyone had meloxicam work for them? even just a little? or have any other med recs i should ask about?

also being in my 20’s i do drink most days, which wouldn’t be a reason for me to not take anything but it’s something i don’t want to have to stop completely when out with friends. any advice on alcohol mixed with either of them?

"newly diagnosed, med questions",comment,"I'm also relatively young and on meloxicam. It's one of the only anti inflammatories that don't give me unmanageable side effects. On it's own, it doesn't help a lot but that would also depend on your dosage. Methotrexate is one of the faster working RA meds and you can expect results within a month, give or take. Others can take up to 4 months to start working. The side effects aren't great but if you time it right, they're manageable. Give yourself a day or two to rest off the effects of each dose at first until you're more familiar with it. There aren't any RA meds that don't have side-effects, unfortunately, and mtx's can be managed with folic acid.

As for the drinking, that's just the reality of meds. Especially RA meds. Ideally, you shouldn't drink with any of them. Most of them interact poorly with alcohol. You can occasionally drink with mtx, just not within 2 or so days of taking a dose. Mtx is metabolized in the liver and drinking only strains your liver more. Prednisone is a corticosteroid and should not be taken with alcohol. Alcohol affects how well it works and can make underlying conditions worse. Most meds mean cutting out alcohol. I know it sucks, especially when you're young. But it's a matter of priority. If you want to keep drinking, consider cutting back a lot. Drinking isn't great but you can still do it if you're doing so in moderation. But consider this, there's no cure for RA yet. All we can do is slow down it's progression. For us younger people, that means we'll be living with it for decades and living on meds for it for decades. That means taking care of your body more than anyone else, especially your liver. A lot of meds are already harsh on your liver. Like my dr said, it doesn't need extra strain. It's a harsh thing to think about but that's the reality of this diagnosis.",7,jh9o9v3,,1682170766

"newly diagnosed, med questions",comment,"Hello! I was diagnosed at 19 and was put on prednisone (5mg daily), methotrexate (20mg weekly) and hydroxychloroquine. Methotrexate changed my life - I went from being in pain every day to eventually only having flares maybe once a fortnight. And then I cut out gluten and only had flares when I fucked up and ate Bread (lol). I stayed on a low dose of prednisone for a while with the intention of going off it once the methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine kicked in. But I ended up having to stay on a low dose (2.5mg) for about 7 years because it was hard to wean off without pain. I never had any severe methotrexate side effects at all. A little fatigue, some nausea in the 24hrs after taking it so now I take it in the evening so I can sleep most of it off. But nothing severe at all. It’s been a game changer for me in combination with he other meds. I feel a bit silly because when I was diagnosed I was so desperate to have relief I didn’t read any information about any side effects, oops. But it ended up working out for me 😂 
Sorry about your diagnosis it really sucks having to deal with such a painful disease so young. 
Also as far as I’m aware meloxicam is just an anti inflammatory (NSAID) NOT an immunosuppressant medication. Therefore isn’t likely do actually do much but mask a little bit of the pain. You need to be on immunosuppressive medication to halt the progression of the disease and prevent joint deformation in the future.

Re: drinking I wasn’t a big drinker anyway but didn’t really have any issues when I wanted to have a night out with friends.

How to deal with the blues?,post,"My wife was diagnosed with RA a few months ago - her doctor started her off with a course of steroid tablets, which seemed to help, and then moved her onto Methotrexate.

How to deal with the blues?,comment,"I have no experience with this medication,but plenty experience with feeling terrible. For me the bottom line is simple: when you feel happy, be happy, when you feel sad, be sad. Life has its ups and downs, trust the process.

That said, it does generally help to take good care of yourself. So make sure to get enough regular sleep, eat healthy, exercise, meditate and above all, listen to your body. If your body tells you that you really need to rest, do that.

Stress is a huge factor when it comes to depression, pain and physical and mental health in general. I personally spend a lot of time reducing stress. That can be through meditation, philosophy, music, what people I hang out with, what sort of work I do for a living, etc.. There's a lot you can do with that.",11,iywg64z,,1670178597
How to deal with the blues?,comment,"Dealing with RA is extremely emotionally draining. Juggling all the doctors, meds, medical terminology, appointments, dealing with pain, fears, etc. 

Try to support your wife as best you can; having RA can feel very isolating. Keep up with her diagnoses, meds, and progress so she can have someone who’s not a doctor to talk/vent about it with. Suggest fun things to do (together or on her own) that will lift her spirits but won’t be too taxing on her inflamed joints - for example if inflammation is limited to her hands/arms y’all could go hiking, or if it’s limited to her knees/legs y’all could do a seated painting class together. Swimming is good because buoyancy takes weight off all joints and exercises them. But the activities could be anything.

How to deal with the blues?,comment,"Like what others are saying, when you’re processing the fact that you have an illness and there’s no cure.. it’s a lot. My dad got his diagnosis almost 10 years ago for RA. I saw him dealing with the emotional weight of it all but I never understood it until I got my diagnosis 2 years ago. He walked into my room with me laying on the floor mourning my health. I was mourning the fact that I was in my late 20s and dealing with this, that I couldn’t be there with my kids like I was before, I was exhausted all the time, and I was struggling with basic things because I’m in constant pain. I felt like my future was so uncertain because of this illness. He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, “I know… I’m sorry.” 

Definitely recommend finding a therapist, but also finding a community with others who go through their own chronic illness battles.

How to deal with the blues?,comment,"I would second on finding a therapist who has experience with chronic pain/illness. I’ve had RA for 13 years and managed the mental aspect fairly well, I thought. But I’ve had a recent, very long flare-up and need to change meds that I’m still working through and it has taken such a toll. 

I finally contacted a therapist because I felt pretty helpless on how to feel better. And having someone who knows chronic pain has been an amazing grieving outlet. I expected her to kind of lift me up and help me think more positively, etc. But she’s actually really made me face the diagnosis and what it means and all the things I feel like I’m losing head on and give me space with her to process it. I would not have guessed this is what I needed—it sounds depressing! But it’s helped me have that time and place to be very sad about it and then learn some tools to work through it on my own as well. 

You’re amazing for asking—this is a really lonely journey and recognizing the gravity of it for your partner goes a long way. ❤️ I really hope she starts feeling better soon.",6,iyxt188,,1670197923

Moving is always the best medicine. I found stretching in the morning super helpful. Also my doctor said I could split the MTX over to 2 days to help with the nausea. She should tell her doctor who may have other options for her.

Good luck. It can get better. I am now off MTX and only on Humira.",3,iywgzbd,,1670178901
How to deal with the blues?,comment,"Give it time. I’m 1.5 years into my diagnosis and am just starting to come out of the “hitting a wall of depression” phase.

I was diagnosed super young (I’m 31 now). RA is a lifelong, incurable autoimmune disorder that is specific to each individual. Not only do you have to wrap your head around the chronic pain management and medication, you have to mentally redefine yourself as someone who has a lifelong diagnosis that will have ups and downs, and you just don’t always know what will trigger the ups or downs. It’s a process of building resilience and accepting life as it comes.

I think a good tip for you as the non-diagnosed partner is to balance cheerful positivity and being a non-advice-giving sounding board, haha. Sometimes I really just want to complain or cry to my partner without judgement or having to look at “the bright side.” That being said, your partners body/life is changing, but it’s not a death sentence! Find the humor but let her determine her own journey through it. Some things she loves might become impossible depending on her condition - let her set the pace and tone, but be there to support if needed.

No one has the answers here. Just stay patient with each other and yourselves, and remember that you also deserve time for some fun/hobbies/enjoying life, even when your partner is going through it. Take care of yourself too, it sounds like you’re an attentive and thoughtful person to be going through this with!",6,iyx2lnq,,1670187049
How to deal with the blues?,comment,"I was diagnosed in the fall of 2021 and have been on MTX ever since. My body tolerates the tablets well, but if your wife continues to experience nausea with them she can ask her rheumy to switch her to the injectable version. My friend did that and found it helped a lot.

When your wife needs to vent to you, ask her if she's solution-oriented and help her with that if she is. If she's not looking for help and just needs to get stuff off her chest, let her, without interruption or judgment or ""helpful"" advice. Listen and nod.

Encourage your wife to see a therapist. Do you know why she doesn't want to? I would look for a therapist that has experience counseling people who have chronic illnesses/chronic pain.

Diagnosed 6 months ago- how much pain is normal daily?,post,"I was diagnosed, it’s in every joint and I could barely walk, talk, or move really. I’m also a type 1 diabetic and have Hoshimotos. 

I’m on methotrexate and Avara, and overall my quality of life better. However my dominant hand and wrist are swollen and tight off and on every week. 

If I knit, paint, do my makeup, anything with that hand really, it will get angry for 3-4 days before going back down. I’ve been icing it, using a compression glove, and taking Tylenol to help. 

Is this normal? Is this my life now, not being able to do anything without my joints swelling up?

Diagnosed 6 months ago- how much pain is normal daily?,comment,"Some doctors will tell you it can take up to six months for meds to start working, but it’s different depending on the med. I didn’t go beyond 3 months with either methotrexate or Arava - the first just didn’t work and made me super tired, and I had awful side effects with the other even though it worked on my arthritis. 

I’ve had this for nearly 9 years, and have been mostly in remission for the last 4. I still can’t crochet (not that I did much of that before). I’m an artist and crafter, and I do have to take more frequent breaks between projects, use ice and other things like compression gloves, and there are times I’ll have to take longer breaks because of pain and swelling. The goal with meds is to get you as close to have as many pain-free days as possible, but there is no cure for this so there will be times your body will rebel, even on meds. You should still discuss this with your doctor because IMO you should be able to do your projects without feeling this way every single time.

Just remember to be gentle with yourself. This does change how your life works, and you might want to consider counseling. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I wouldn’t be able to do things the same way I did prior to getting this disease. Counseling and groups like these are a great help, and open lines of communication with your doc are necessary. Good luck and gentle hugs.",5,jw08xqr,,1691937156

And right now I’m on the way towards remission again and my daily pain is random aches every now and then, maybe my neck will hurt for 10-15 minutes straight on my drive into work, or my wrists are tender when I grab my heavy thermos, or my chest aches (the cartilage) occasionally. My hips ache when I drive for longer than an hour and I’m stiff in the morning. None of these things affect my day to day life, just nuances, slight inconveniences. And I started with limping on a treadmill for 10 minutes a day and being covered in hives and my jaw was swollen shut. I have psoriatic arthritis (the hives) but anyway the quality of life on meds is pretty nice! I snowboarded all winter and I have a farm with lots of landscaping projects. I’m female if that matters but I mention that because I’m strong enough even with RA/PsA to fix my truck, to have a garden, to take care of several animals, to chop down trees, to workout, to cook, to clean, to hike, to swim, to do renovation projects, to paint walls, to replace windows, to mow the lawn, to carry all my groceries in one trip, and to keep a stable job.

My rheumatologist also shared a tip with me that joints that are stiff, swollen and painful because of RA do need warmth, not cold (I don’t mean joint damage already done, but active inflammation). Dry heat (so heat pack, not a shower) is the best. Even though the immediate effect of ice is nice, it’s not good for the joint (according to my doctor). I don’t use ice, but a heat pad and I see huge difference. It does not help with the pain like ice, but after the joint is warmed, it slowly gets less stiff and than the pain usually gets better as well. But my joints also react to weather, when it’s cold and rainy, even my not so bad joints don’t cooperate… So it kind of makes sense for me. Maybe it can help",1,jwa90v4,,1692107199

The wife has the RA and she's now on methotrexate. the question is can she take turmeric and or curcumin to help with the flares and not interfere with the meds?,comment,Yes you can but turmeric is best absorbed by the body when taken with black pepper.

Typically only useful is the target is the GI tract because it ain't going anywhere else. Certain expensive preparations make it bioavailable. Phytosones etc. Like longvida . Black pepper extract people recommend taking it with work by inhibiting the liver in breaking down chemicals etc. Might not be advisable honestly. Having said all that, I highly recommend moringa leaf extract. It's been studied to help with ra and prevent some of the side effects of methotrexate. Make sure it's a leaf extract only and don't fall for gimmicky crap. bronson and zazzee make the best ones I've yet found.",1,ja86vtd,,1677513194

No Medications are Working,post,"Hi! I’m a 35 yr old female and I have seronegative RA. I got it over night in November 2021, and it has been severe the whole time. 

I have tried Plaquenil (caused long QT syndrome), sulfasalazine (worked a tiny bit and then stopped - I’m still taking this at max dose), methotrexate (triggers an insane amount of hair loss and severe depression/suicidal thoughts), tried leflunomide (also caused hair loss and didn’t help at all), then I tried Humira (didn’t work), next was Rinvoq, which worked well until I had to stop taking it for 3 weeks for a major surgery, and now it’s not working at all after 3 months of being back on it.

I also take max dose of meloxicam twice daily, and cannot take corticosteroids due to causing severe depression and suicidal ideation almost immediately.

My doctors say my next try is Xeljanz, which is fine with me to try, but I feel like I’m running out of options. I’ve been at this for a year and a half and am going insane from the pain and lack of ability to use my hands.

Just started on methotrexate :),comment,"methotrexate worked wonderfully for my arthritis, but i had rough side effects which ultimately led me to stop taking it. the side effects (for me at least) only appeared and lasted for the day after the dose (injection or pills, i tried both). so hopefully you are in the clear for any negative side effects! i know it works for many people without side effects.

as for your questions: if you don't notice any side effects, it's probably unlikely you will lose or gain weight or your hair will fall out. without going into detail, i did lose some weight and my hair got thinner, but without noticeable side effects i don't see this happening (ie having nausea, not able to keep food down --> losing weight). take your folic acid! it helps mitigate side effects. also if you do start to experience side effects bring it up with your doctor because they may be able to prescribe meds to help (like zofran for nausea, lifesaver for me)

Been in denial- Looking for helpful tips,post,"I was diagnosed with snra in 2018 and tried 1 dose of methotrexate and and I felt terrible. I wasn’t sure if I felt like I really had RA since it was seronegative and that it was something else that was causing the fevers, joint pain and recurring mouth sores. My sister had been diagnosed with lupus about 2 years before she died from heart failure. My ANA was negative which is why they thinks it’s RA. So I spent the next few years changing my diet to make it less anti inflammatory but I’m still having flares with different joints every couple of weeks.

So anyways I’m going back to my doctor in 2 weeks to try medication since I have to return to the office at work. Last week was terrible as it was super cold and my hands were hurting more and felt more stiff. I can’t bring any heating pads in and I only get minimal relief with fingerless mittens. Does anyone have any helpful ideas to deal with pain other than pain medication which is something I refuse to take? I’m currently going to the gym every other day and use heating pads before bed.

Been in denial- Looking for helpful tips,comment,"You’re still in denial.

You need to take medications to treat your autoimmune condition, not pain management medications. 

The methotrexate is to manage the RA not to treat the pain. If you don’t take medications to manage the RA you WILL definitely be causing yourself more sickness and more damage and more problems in the long run. 

Homeopathic remedies cannot, do not and will not help. 

Making changes to your diet is good and so is exercising. 

Please go and research what an autoimmune condition is, what RA is and how the medications work to manage it.

Been in denial- Looking for helpful tips,comment,"I know you don't want to take pain medications and I also don't like taking them (I get heartburn sometimes and also don't want to deal with the ulcer risk so I only take them if I need them). two things I might suggest though if you're amenable to them are topical antiinflammatories and Tylenol. topical antiinflammatories are things such as Voltaren which is OTC and Pennsaid which you might be able to get a Rx from your doc. these are both diclofenac, an antiinflammatory/NSAID. the only difference between them is Voltaren is 1% and Pennsaid is 2%. you do still absorb a small amount, but it's small enough that even some people who are contraindicated for taking oral antiinflammatories are able to use them.

tylenol is not an NSAID and doesn't have an ulcer risk. there are obviously risks to every drug, so I def respect if you still don't want to take it, was just throwing it out there bc some people don't know it's not the same kind of drug as like an ibuprofen/naproxen.

I've heard some people also like creams such as arnicare, blue emu, biofreeze, CBD, etc. these are hit or miss, but some people swear by them. they don't have antiinflammatories like the voltaren/pennsaid.

if you can wear gloves to work, my suggestion is those little ""hot hands"" packs you can put in them. these help to keep my hands warm and help with pain. there's also microwavable hot pack gloves you can get which work wonders. there's different kinds you can find on amazon. you might also want to try compression gloves if you've only tried regular fingerless gloves. there's heat patches you can get at the pharmacy too which are hit or miss. I've found that they don't get warm enough for me and don't stick right, but if you can find one you like they can be great!

if your insurance will cover it (and if you're able to tolerate it), I also had a decent amount of relief from acupuncture! it didn't solve all my problems, but it did help somewhat when I tried it. that obviously doesn't help you while you're cold or sitting at work, but it's just something else you might wanna try.

I hope you're able to get some relief! I also hope you and your doc can find a med that helps. some people really don't tolerate MTX well, but there's lots of other drugs out there that work wonders for people with significantly less side effects.",8,iuds8ug,,1667145174
Been in denial- Looking for helpful tips,comment,"It sounds like you aren't actually treating your (SN)RA at all. Which is worrisome as RA lessens one's lifespan and is crippling in end stages. And SNRA patients have a tendency to have worse outcomes than S+ RA.

I'm not sure what kind of techniques you are looking for - diet isn't treatment. RA requires medical treatment. Taking one Methotrexate, without giving it time to work or yourself to acclimate to it, isn't sufficient. Generally, they recommend 6 to 8 weeks to verify whether the treatment plan works.

Additionally, there are numerous OTHER medical treatments available.

Been in denial- Looking for helpful tips,comment,"ANA can fluctuate but Plaquenil and MTX do treat lupus so even if your diagnosis of RA isn't correct technically certain meds treat both so you would be covered either way. 

I'm diagnosed with both lupus and snRA. We tried treating both separately and I didn't get overall relief until we treated both. My ANA was positive though. 

My suggestions: 

Compression gloves 

Marijuana/ CBD. CBD doesn't do much for me but it works for other people so it's worth a shot if marijuana is not legal in your area and CBD is.

Been in denial- Looking for helpful tips,comment,"It might take you several different stops and starts with medications to find what works for your body. It can be really frustrating at the start, especially when each new med can take 6-8 weeks before you start feeling the effects. 

You’ve made a great start to dealing with your pain by making dietary changes and exercising regularly. 
The dietary changes that worked for me personally were cutting out the main inflammation triggers like processed sugars, grains (corn is a grain) and dairy. Going low carb, cutting out soy and nightshades and cutting back on red meat also helped. All that took me around five years to figure out. 
Your body will be different. (Apart from sugar, grains and dairy) 

Exercises like hydrotherapy in heated pools, yoga, Pilates etc are all good options as they don’t pressure on joints. I had a physiotherapist for a while that was really helpful with all that too. 

I also went to counselling for a while, the therapist really helped me with learning how to think about my pain differently. She was a huge help. 

Talk to the Rheumatologist about different pain management options. Keep in mind that goal isn’t to be totally pain free but to learn how to manage your new reality of pain. Compression gear helps me a lot too. 

I have a number of conditions and was bedridden for several years. I did LOTS of reading (I come from a professional medical background so that did help a lot), changed my diet, went to the physio and the counsellor and now I’m working again, living independently again and going back to school. My daily pain rumbles along at about 3 or 4 most days but I can usually filter most of it out. I need to be careful to rest and to be realistic about what I can no longer do (foster kids, pound rescues, volunteer work). 

Your life will look different, that’s ok, be patient with yourself while you are learning. Do lots of reading, you are your own best advocate. Take your health into your own hands.",1,iuerra2,,1667159365

Exercise with RA,post,"I am recently diagnosed with RA, as in March 27th of this year. My pain and symptoms are still not gone, but I know that the meds take time to kick in and that we might have to switch things up again.  (On Methotrexate, Hydoxychloroque and Prednisone(for now)).  I am still having pain, stiffness and swelling in my hands and knees. 

I used to be a bicycle commuter but stopped a few months before diagnoses as my hands couldn't support me or work the brakes. Due to the intense flare up I had which led to the diagnoses I lost a bunch of weight.  This weight lost even though it did not come in a healthy manner is welcome and I would like to keep it up, went from a 22 to an 18 in pant size for women.

Exercise with RA,comment,"Gotta be aware that the prednisone, being a steroid, will limit any strength work you want to do. Too much strain can mess your joints up more. My rheumy was insistent and it was very frustrating.   
As others have said, gentle, non-stressful work is the way, which for me meant time in the pool, including hydrotherapy for the warm water benefits.   
As soon as I was off the prednisone (biologic was a game changer!) I was able to concentrate on building up muscle that I'd lost. Particularly to take strain off the joints by making the muscle do the work.   
For me that's the exercise bike at home and then off to the gym 3 or more days a week (it has a 25m pool so that means weight machines followed by laps.)

If Everyone Can Handle Another Methotrexate Question...,post,"I did a search, but didn't find quite what I was looking for. Anyway, my doc started me on Methotrexate injections in January. I've been on Plaquenil for almost two years and Sulfasalazine for about a year with just minor relief. 

So, I was very hopeful that Methotrexate would be a miracle drug for me. After 8 weeks, I went back in for blood work and reported no change in symptoms. Thankfully, I've also had ZERO side effects from any of the meds. The PA informed me that my dosage (.4ml) was under the minimum medically effective dose and increased me to .6. I just felt so defeated. Two months wasted on a dose that was never going to work! And I understand that it takes months to become effective. So, I've been on the .6 ml dosage for 6 weeks or so (I'd have to go back to my calendar to get exact dates). No side effects, but also no change in symptoms. In fact, my right knee and right foot have gotten worse since then. 😔 I'm just so sad. We have a big trip coming up in about 8 weeks and when I started on methotrexate, I was SO hopeful that I'd be nearly pain-free by then. Here we are, nearly four months later and nothing. 

At what point do I concede that it has failed? Am I just not giving it enough time? Do I need a higher dose? I'm a small person, if that matters...5' tall and I bounce between 115 and 120 lbs.

RA and Menstruation Issues,comment,"Hey, Sorry you're going through this! I'm 34 and was born with JRA. I've just had my 3rd early period in a row. My days are getting shorter between periods, 21d, 17d and now 13d. I don't think mine is related to the RA tho and I haven't been on mtx for years now and haven't tried any other DMARDs yet. My mum had premature menopause at 34yo, and it started with periods every 2 weeks. It can be hereditary, so unfortunately I'm thinking mine is this too. I've also read a study that said the O blood type has a lower egg count, so it could also be Primary Ovarian Insufficiency. I've just had my bloods done yesterday and I'll have to wait a week for the hormone profile to come back. I'll need a few more hormone tests to see if there is a decline in estrogen. It's good that you've seen your obgyn and started getting your tests done too. I know it's rough waiting to find out what's going on and I just wanted to let you know that you're not alone! Good luck with your tests and virtual hugs! 🫂💜",5,k5ilbcc,,1697699998

RA and Menstruation Issues,comment,"I (22) just wanted to mention my experience if you wanted another point of reference. I’m on Sulfasalazine and prescribed birth control. Before birth control, I would have between 30-50 days of no period between each one which were extremely painful when the pandemic started. After getting prescribed birth control, I had a 28 day cycle with a lot less pain. When I got diagnosed in February this year, I would have stains for a couple days before and after the end of my supposed periods but eventually my body readjusted and returned to only having bleeding in the last week of the birth control without stains.",2,k5p833h,,1697815161

RA and Menstruation Issues,comment,"I am also experiencing issues here! I have had on/off periods my whole life - maybe one every 4-5 months. I started methotrexate a month ago and have had the heaviest and longest period of my life. To the point that if I was in a relationship I would have been sure I must have been miscarrying. I can only connect it to new medicine however I have suspicions it’s not methotrexate but the folic acid affecting me. Are you on folic acid too?

It lasted three whole weeks, and I was away last weekend and skipped my folic acid on the Wednesday I usually take it as it was making me nauseous. My period was gone by the Sunday. I then took my dose again on Wednesday and it was back by Friday afternoon.

Pretty Upset just want to vent!!,post,"About six months ago I started having bad flares in my hands wrists and knees. Every morning it's a surprise to find out what hurts. Or what digit is stuck in a curled position if it's going to be difficult to walk.

 I just lost my medicaid and had to enroll in health care from my workplace.  Between the time my medicaid ran out and the time that my new insurance will kick in is a two month period that I just have to wait and suffer.  Im just feeling really pissed off about it because i was literally two vaccinations away from beginning some treatment!  I was SO CLOSE!! 

I live on an island pretty far away from what most people would consider ""conveniences.""  For instance,  in order to see an actual rheumatologist,  i would have to travel because there isn't one where i live.  Without medicaid, traveling will be a hardship.   But it looks like my primary doctor is willing to start me on methotrexate if i have an eye exam and i get the hep B vaccination, and i have no issue with doing these things.  On July 1st i can continue my forward progress towards treatment.

Im just feeling discouraged because in the past month i have developed new nodules in one finger joint.  Im really really ready to start treatment. 

Okay well thanks for letting me share, i try really hard not to talk too much about this stuff with anyone because i feel like my disease or my pain will feel like a burden to them or i wiĺl feel like a negative presence.  No one says that to me, but my ex husband admitted (after we were divorced) that he felt secretly that i would be a burden as we aged, as when we were married i didnt have RA yet.

I'm also wondering if your PCP might consider putting you on Plaquanil or hydroxychloroquine, also, as long as you're having your eyes tested anyway. It's pretty common to start us on it, and according to my rheumy, it's an important tool for them to keep inflammation under control.

I've just been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and things are really confusing to me,post,"
6 months ago I was diagnosed with hashimoto's thyroiditis which is an autoimmune system disorder, so it wasn't a surprise when I was diagnosed with RA 2 weeks ago with RA. There's no (known) history of autoimmune system disorders in my family. The doctor prescribed hydroxychloroquine, calcium and methotrexate injections (weekly injection). I had an ultrasound of my knees and hands, which showed minor effusion in my knees and minor inflammation /effusion in my fingers and wrists. It's been 3 weeks and I haven't noticed any improvement in my symptoms if bot worse. My knees, wrists and toes (the joints between my foot and toes not all the knuckles) hurt all day everyday but especially in the morning. I've noticed somethings that I don't know if they're normal with RA or not. If I sit down with my feet touching the floor, my knees pain greatly  increases within 30 minutes. Also, If I carry the lightest bag for like 5 minutes,I wake up the next morning with elbow pain that continues for 3 days. The top side of my foot hurts when I step on it or move my toes,which is also at it's peak in the morning. My doctor aaid RA only affects small joints like in your hands, otherwise RA is not the reason. I'm starting to panic and I'm really concerned because I'm only 24 and I don't wabt to be in pain my whole life .

Maybe the dr. said that ""it starts in the small joints"" ???

Otherwise, I would be cautious about this rheumatologist. Mine isn't fabulous. He talks too fast & only spends about 11 minutes with me, so I stopped driving all that way for a 11 minute appointment & do telehealth instead. He writes down in his notes that he spends 40 minutes with me for each appointment. He wouldn't take me seriously about my pain level until my husband chimed in & said ""Hey, she's not exaggerating.

"Prednisone and triple therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine",comment,"Yup, it's called the triple therapy, very effective but I wouldn't recommend starting them all at once because if you experience any side effects you wouldn't be able to know which drug caused it if you start them all at the same time.

However, that's not the reality for some of us. Even with a biologic, I'm on a cocktail of medications and still having issues. Which do you honestly think is more unhealthy - multiple medications or uncontrolled RA? Either way, shaming people's medications is not cool. Take a step back and reevaluate yourself.

How would you even know which of the med is giving you side effects if you start 3 at a time?

And yes, I do think taking a bunch of metho, hydro and prednisone is unhealthy, in the long run it will ruin pretty much anyone's health, and many studies will show that. Notice their cocktail has zero biologics, which are the most effective class of meds for RA and have the least long-term side effects.",1,iu9eugg,,1667059961
"Prednisone and triple therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine",comment,"I had literally zero side effects from essentially the same med combo. If you've never been on them, how can you say there will be a ton??

My insurance also required me to try all these before they would cover a biologic. And I was still on all while taking the biologic. Without the mtx, the biologic didn't work as well for me.

Again, nice to know that your disease isn't that severe and you're able to control it with just the biologic. That's not the case for a large number of us. You're speaking from a place of privilege, which is dangerous to someone who needs more medication than you apparently do.",2,iu9njtk,,1667063651

I unfortunately didn’t record the dates. My period has also started early after taking methotrexate. My rheum was afraid I was pregnant (thankfully, I wasn’t), but did not think the spotting was associated with methotrexate. I’m supposed to be seeing a gynecologist, but it is taking SO long to get in. 

It seemed so related though. Cramping and spotting 1-2 hours after taking methotrexate on more than one occasion? Definitely weird.

Methotrexate and spotting,comment,I’m not on Methotrexate but I started sulfasalazine as I was recently diagnosed. I’m on birth control pill and I noticed spotting before my periods too. There’s not much to say though since I started about 2 months ago so only went through 2 cycles. My period started later than before I was prescribed sulfasalazine. I did ask my rheumatologist last time I saw him if it affects my birth control but he said no and double check with the pharmacist if I’m concerned.

Methotrexate and spotting,comment,"Methotrexate messed with my periods. I had regular periods, and I missed my cycle completely after taking Methotrexate. Following month I spotted. Third month it was abnormally long. Now its finally back on track.

As far as headache and extreme fatigue following taking Methotrexate I experience that too. A lot of people call it the methotrexate hangover. I would wake up super nauseous the following day. I was about to call it quits but everything is good now on that part and have not had to deal with the metho hangover in a while now. Trade off is I now struggle with anemia from Methotrexate.

I hope you feel better soon xo  


Edit to say. I don't think your IUD is causing this issue. My rheumatologist actually encouraged an IUD to prevent pregnancy while on this drug. Methotrexate is an intense drug.",2,jefi9bn,,1680282535

Left rib cage pain? Tapering off of prednisone and on methotrexate,post,"Hi everyone! I’ve been on methotrexate for five consecutive weeks and wanted to start tapering my prednisone, so I had gotten it down to 2.5mg and was there for a bit until I completely stopped. This is my fourth day without it, and not only are my joints in a lot of pain today, but the bottom of the left side of rib cage aches terribly - the pain is akin to my usual joint pain. Sometimes when I breathe I’ll feel the ache spread up to the left side of my chest / around my heart area. Has this happened to anyone else? The ache has caused me to wake up from sleeping.

Scared about switching to MTX,post,"Hello fellow spoonies; can anyone share a little about their experience with methotrexate ? 

I’m currently on hydroxychloroquine and etolodac, but I think I may need to switch to something new. I’ve been in a flare that’s been fluctuating in severity for at least a month. I feel like garbage everyday and in more than my usual amount of pain. My doctor and i had touched previously on considering methotrexate to be the next step since I’ve already tried so many drug combos, but I’m hesitant to switch based on some of the stories I’ve heard about side effects. But who knows, everyone’s body reacts to things differently— it might be worth it for me to try if it means i can fricken walk normal lol",2,122rd2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/122rd2z/scared_about_switching_to_mtx/,1679847693
Scared about switching to MTX,comment,"I’ve been on MTX for five weeks now. Life changer. I couldn’t walk much before and had to work from home most days. I’m able to now go into the office five days a week. No concerning side effects. I do have some nausea and fatigue the few days after my weekly dose. I take mine on Friday nights to combat this. Each week the intensity of the side affects has decreased. This past dose I had no fatigue. I did have some hair loss in the beginning but I switched to a different shampoo and chopped off the dead hair and it seems to have lessened. I’ve had much worse reactions to hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. I think it won’t hurt to try it, and if it doesn’t work out you can go to something else. None of the side effects I’ve heard are possible are permanent and should dissipate after you quit the meds. And that’s worse case scenario. Best case - you get your life back.

It's worth a mention that I haven't had any side effects other than fatigue, but this can be different for others. I'm also doing physical therapy 1x every 2 weeks and they help a ton too.

I think I'm starting to notice a difference with my feet after starting MTX. A few other posts I've seen have mentioned taking it with Lactaid. The MTX pills contain lactose, so this is thought to contribute to the nightmarish gastrointestinal side effects that others have experienced. I have taken Lactaid with each dose so far and have had mild nausea here and there along with some gas, but that's it. I also have a pretty sensitive stomach. I can't take Tylenol without having eaten first unless I want to throw up. I lost weight when I was pregnant because I couldn't get a handle on my nausea.

The side effects have gotten more intense for me over the past 2 years. It could be partially because it's an injection and I loathe it. But the smell of alcohol wipes makes me nauseous. It screws with my PVCs for 2 days after, and makes me feel pretty ill.

Rheumatoid Arthritis,post,"Hello everyone,

I just recently got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and am quite new to how all of this works so, I was hoping someone could answer my questions. Thankfully I have been doing well with rheumatoid arthritis, I have a much milder case as It only affects my right knee with inflammation that prevents me from bending and mobilising it. 

Additionally, since I hopped on some anti inflammation medication the swelling has severely decreased and allowed me to move normally. Along with that I have been taking Methotrexate weekly and Sulfasalazine daily.

I was just curious to know whether arthritis affects one’s fertility? and whether I can eventually stop taking these medications?

Thanks",1,zyvt8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/zyvt8q/rheumatoid_arthritis/,1672390706
Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"Unfortunately this is a disease that will be with you for the rest of your life. It is progressive, so you will have to carefully  manage it with medications and lifestyle changes. You may be able to go into a remission (little to no symptoms) but you will have to continue on the meds to prevent flare ups (a sudden increase in symptoms causing pain and possibly joint damage). Any joint damage is permanent, and not taking the meds can also cause damage to organs such as heart and lungs. I know this all sounds scary, but we are lucky to have a bunch of various meds we can take to keep the disease under control. You will learn through experience what triggers can put you into a flare or worsen your symptoms - it varies from person to person, but things like stress, alcohol, diet, lack of sleep can affect you. Some form of gentle exercise, limiting processed foods, or cutting out gluten can be helpful. Fertility is not usually affected, but if you plan on getting pregnant be sure to discuss it with your Rheumatologist as some of the meds should not be taken while pregnant, but there are meds that will be safe to take. This all sounds like a lot, and it is, but once you figure out what works for you, you can live a full life in spite of having RA.  It is a journey, not a quick fix. Best of luck❤️",6,j290s8b,,1672412417
Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"Hi! I've been diagnosed since 31 (currently 38) tho I had symptoms since my early to mid 20s. 

Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive disease. It started out in my elbow and my thumb joint. It then spread. So now my hands, wrists, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet and oddly enough my jaw on both hinges have all flared at one time or another. My knee caps are also weak so when I stand up during a flare there is a good chance I could have my kneecap slip out of place too which is a whole additional level of excruciating pain. 

Thankfully my Dr who diagnosed me at 31 is a good man (not good bedside by any means) but has ALWAYS  taken me for my word and has done what he can to make  sure I'm not in constant pain and adjusting/ changing meds as needed. 

I didn't have that much luck as a younger woman - most drs focused on my weight, my dietary habits or my stress levels. It was frustrating to not get help for something that kept occuring. I even had one Dr say the arthritic nodules on my arms were calluses from me leaning against my desk while I typed at work..yeah... No they freaking weren't. They disappeared once I got on proper meds. 

I've been on 4 different meds including pain meds. I stopped taking the injection biologic at 35 when I became pregnant (some of the other ones you need to wean off first before - this one he said to just stop when you find out). I was lucky and my symptoms disappeared with pregnancy (it's not guaranteed but was a positive side effect! Haha!)  I was able to conceive within two cycles so no delay in fertility for me from the meds! 

However pain symptoms hit me like a freight train come 4 weeks after birth. Took my injection and it did nothing. I switched to a pill version and have been taking that pill version since 2020. I am generally pain free - tho weather changes do create flares in my shoulders and knees. Over the counter pain meds for 12 hours usually does the trick!

I do have damage in my hands and knees - there's no changing that now - so I know as I get older there will be more issues. Right now I'm working on just being as pain free as I can be to enjoy my life. I get blood work done every 6ish months and have been doing good at each of my check ins with him!",5,j2ag30j,,1672432398

Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"Oh good! I'm glad it gave you some peace! I totally get it - a diagnosis is both a relief of finally being right that something was wrong but also scary because what does the future hold? 

This is a long term game. And honestly every day can be different! Which is both good and bad. Good when you're in pain and need a break but also after a good day a bad day can sneak up on you. 

Also something most don't actually talk about is fatigue!

I forgot it in my post because I chase a 2 year old toddler everyday now so being tired is 'normal' trait haha! 

But fatigue can be annoying because I'd do something normal - like grocery shop or be out and about for the morning and suddenly you are so tired. You can't keep your eyes open, if you lay on a couch it's a guaranteed nap even caffeine has problems touching that level of tiredness. 

So my recommendation if you find that's starting to affect you - plan it into your day. You're going to be busy? Add a half hour or hour of sitting going through email or lay in bed and scroll on your phone. Set an alarm incase you nodd off! I wish I had acknowledged it more when I was younger - I often pushed myself too hard and then I was very tired and then flares were even worse. 

Good luck!",2,j2an3wa,,1672435125

I do know plaquenil has some side effects with your eyes, I personally didn’t live it so wasn’t on it long. The drug that changed my life was Rituximab, a biologic drug that you do through infusion. It feels like I don’t have arthritis most of the time and I almost never flare on it. The downside to these drugs is the price, I had to get sick enough to get coverage for them.

RA is a very individual disease, finding the right medication for yourself is more of a journey than a quick fix.

Would you get a second opinion?,post,"Would you get a second opinion?

Hi everyone I'm curious to what others think about this. 
I was recently diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis or seronegative arthritis.

It's not that I don't believe something is going on with my body, I've actually really been trying to figure it out (for years). But I'm scared I don't have the ""proof"" from labs and imaging etc.

I am a 29 year old female. Diagnosed with Graves' disease last year and hypermobility for years. Chronic migraine suffer. 

I have been ANA + (1:320) for over 5 years and doctors just kept saying since other labs normal keep moving on.


About 4.5 months ago I was having terrible fatigue and joint/muscle pain. This has been in feet/ankles and hands/wrist. At one point I went to Arizona  for work and one morning I woke up and my hand was stuck and stiff for 20+ minutes. Since that I noticed my hands/feet hurt/stiff every morning or in the evening at rest. With repetitive movement my hands hurt. 

I waited to get into rheum. They ran some more labs - all came back normal. Esr and cpr high end of normal. 

X-ray hands normal no erosions. 

On exam doctor noted inflammation to ankles and hands per their notes. 

Doctor trial me on prednisone taper and I felt much better and had energy. 

I told doc this and now he wants me to start on methotrexate. 

Here is why I feel like an imposter: my labs are pretty normal (minus the Ana) and it doesn't show up on the X-ray. 


I forgot to add my great grandma had RA and my grandma has multiple sclerosis. 

Does anyone else feel like this or have advice?",10,15ovx64,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/15ovx64/would_you_get_a_second_opinion/,1691818413
Would you get a second opinion?,comment,"I have gone through the same thing recently. Since June/July I had pain and stiffness in hands/wrists knees/ankles/feet in the morning and at night that came out of nowhere. My blood test and everything were normal. Talked to my family and my mum and auntie said they had rheumatoid arthritis as kids/teens. I saw a rheumatologist who said I have seronegative RA. It would be nice if it turned up on the labs so I would know for sure because I understand the feeling of imposter syndrome. My scans showed perfect joints no damage. But I don't want to not do the treatment because I have done research and I don't want to risk it getting bad. Since starting methotrexate (20mg orally once a week) my symptoms have been better. I will probably start hydroxychloroquine in a couple months. 

I don't think the imposter feeling will go away but with the family history you have and the symptoms it's a pretty strong indicator. And for a rheumatologist to say you do have it means you do, they are the experts. I reckon listen to the doctors and do the treatments because it's not worth the pain and suffering.",4,jvud5sw,,1691825213
Would you get a second opinion?,comment,"Yes. Sorry, don’t have time to read everything. But yes.

I was diagnosed with RA circa 2018. At least I thought I was. Due to some miscommunication (on my doctor’s part) and misunderstanding (on my part), I didn’t. And I didn’t find out until about a year ago… after getting tested again.

In fact, the fact I’m subscribed to this sub is evidence of me seeking out information from others with the condition. And this sub did not let me down.

Get another opinion. At least in my opinion, and good luck. Although I was happy to learn I didn’t have RA, my pain didn’t stop. It’s just a different name now.",3,jvuhzwf,,1691829030

I’m on Kevzara and I too feel like it isn’t “sure” and doubt the necessity of this heavy treatment. But, I have seen end-stage RA in patients and family and I DO NOT want to end up like that, so I have decided to trust the rheumatologist and continue the treatment.",3,jvup81t,,1691834846
Would you get a second opinion?,comment,"Cero-negative here, too but from a different perspective. To make a long story short, for most of my life I have other health issues (a very crap spine) that have drawn attention. I was a ""neurology/orthopaedic patient"". Through much of my adult life I have had random joint pain in other places, and on more than one occasion I was told that I might benefit from a rheumatologist. For example, I began having bad jaw pains. I even went to my GP because I thought I had an ear infection. They suggested I see a rheumy, but I didn't follow up because I didn't think I had RA. Same basic story with different joints (my wrist hurts because I use a cane, my hips hurt because of my spine surgeries) several times for years. When I ultimately became disabled my osteoarthritis was in full swing, so I went to a rheumatologist. It took about 3 visits for her to figure out that I had very unchecked ceroneg RA. Not to sound like a drama queen, but I *really* wish I would have been more proactive. If your physicians are telling you that you need treatment, and you trust them, listen! If you don't then get a second opinion. You need/deserve it and it may prevent a LOT of crap down the road. One more thing -- we had a very similar post recently. This reminds me of ""imposter syndrome"" which is that people often feel like they will be found out to be ""not good enough""for something. Like when a person earns a teaching degree, but when they start working they're terrified that someone will say ""you aren't good enough for this!! How did *you* get a degree?"" Google it! But you, OP and others here, deserve to be cared for, and you deserve treatment to ensure you don't get your ass majority kicked later.

I was diagnosed with arthritis when I was 18 years old, I suspected that something was not right because for almost a month I had bilateral joint pain in my hands. In the beginning of my diagnosis the pain was tolerable and I could do a lot of things, but my mom decided to visit some family and I got the flu from one of my little cousins. It was really bad, because of the inmune reaction, my knees got all swollen together with the joints of my upper limbs, my mom had to help me to change clothes because it hurted a lot to move on my own. Since then the pain and the inflammation never leave me. For two years I was only taking:

Oral corticosteroids.

Methotrexate.

Hydroxychloroquine.

Methotrexate and depression,post,"I have had RA for over 25 years and avoided RA meds completely. I read all the information and I’ve been scared about the side effects. I already take medication for depression and anxiety. My rheumatoid arthritis has gone completely out of control and I am scheduled to see my rheumatologist for the first time in years this February. 

However, in December my rheumatoid arthritis was so out of control I had to contact my doctor and ask him to prescribe me steroids to get me through the month so I could work. I ended up using all the steroids and so he suggested he start me on a very small dosage of methotrexate until I can get in to see the rheumatologist in February. I readily agreed because I need to work and at this point I was not able to continue with this much pain.

After two weeks of medication, I have already noticed the methotrexate not only helping with my rheumatoid arthritis, but a significant reduction in my depression. I can feel that depression sneaking back just a day or two before I’m due for my next dosage of methotrexate. I take the methotrexate once a week. I have not had any side effects from the medication, yet. Of course, I am on the smallest as possible and I will need to increase because I am still having some flareups.

Has anyone else noticed a decrease in depression after starting medication for rheumatoid arthritis? I feel so foolish for not starting the medication sooner!

Methotrexate side effects advice please?,post,"UK, NHS treatment here.

This post isn't about knocking Methotrexate and I don't want to hear anyone's horror stories please. I would however like some sensible feedback regarding possible side effects please. 

Been taking 10mg Folic acid and MTX 15mg pills the following day, for 6 weeks now. 

At my most recent rheumatology appt they said my inflammatory markers had come down which is good news. 

When I described the side effects I was struggling with however, they dismissed them as all in my mind and absolutely not caused by MTX.  
They even said that the headache the day after taking the tablets only happens for the first two weeks, which is not my experience at all.

I'm getting continuous low mood / depression, brain-fog, tired aching muscles in my legs and acid stomach with bloating and wind. (Also alterations in food taste, but that's something I can work around.)

I'm also getting severe tinnitus and a bad headache plus migraines, all of which last around 3-4 days, after each dose. They literally said all this was caused by 'anxiety' and couldn't be caused by MTX.

They offered me Leflunomide as an alternative, but said it had the same gastric side effects, and also Amitriptyline for the migraines / depression, but I declined both as the Leflunomide sounded just as bad and being an older person I don't want to add Amitriptyline to the burden of drugs my body's already dealing with.

I just feel so demoralised; are they correct that MTX couldn't cause these issues and I'm imagining it all?

Edit: I just wanted to thank everybody for all your responses - you've been really helpful and have given me lots of really good suggestions to think about.

Methotrexate side effects advice please?,comment,"I had some bad side effects when I first started taking MTX, and I had a similar response from my doctor about it likely being anxiety related. I was pretty dismissive over that, but his suggestion was to take them in the evening, instead of during the day. That way, I would sleep through the worst of any side effects. 

That's what I did, and it really helped. Interestingly though, I recently had to take them much earlier in the day, and I was bracing myself for terrible side effects again - but nothing happened.

Methotrexate side effects advice please?,comment,"I had a lot of the same side effects you're describing. The way my rheumy explained it to me is mtx is metabolized in the liver and the whole dose is processed over the course of two or three hours. Which is why you get those uncomfortable borderline hangover symptoms the next day.

I had horrific headaches the two days after a dose and the only way to get rid of them was folic acid. I also have chronic migraines but they're very different from the mtx headaches. Since folic acid inhibits mtx it's generally recommended to not take it the same day as your mtx dose so I skipped folic acid that day and doubled up for the day after. I was on 5mg daily so in essence I took 10mg the morning after my mtx. I think the max daily dose is 20mg but regardless make sure you're drinking enough water to properly metabolize it. 

There's not much to do about the mood but low dose amitriptylene does wonders. Amitriptylene can have some serious side effects but they're less risky on low dosages. I've been on it for years and it's helped my mood, pain, and sleep a lot.

Mtx is also pretty rough on the stomach. I know the mere thought of food and water is unpleasant the day after a dose but you need to eat. It truly helps. I lived on dry toast and black coffee although anything with ginger or mint in it also helped. If the gastrointestinal side effects are too much bring up injections with your doctor. 

There's a reason why people take doses on Fridays and then disappear for the weekend. Because the side effects can suck. Take it easy while you adjust. It can take a few months to really figure it out.",6,k0jyjos,,1694701254

A noticeable difference is that I take 5mg folic acid six days a week - could you try taking it through the week, not just the day before? (I've also noticed some people take the folic acid every day).

I would say brain fog and fatigue are pretty standard for both RA generally and mtx. The pills also gave me a horrible taste in my mouth.

I am a 42yr old male who was diagnosed in Jan of 2022 with RA. It was clearly present for years prior but I had awful doctors.

Been on MTX this whole time (injection) and while better my flares have gotten worse, prednisone doesn’t seem to anything but make me eat like a beast. 

I start Humira tomorrow in combination with my MTX and I’m excited. As well as seeing a new DR in July.

I honestly want to cry and live in a hole (which I never do) 24/7. My focus just isn’t what it used to be and my career depends on it.

How is this my life, how am I this weak and in pain daily. If this is how things will continue I just can’t imagine. My family unjustly takes the brunt of it as I am miserable and exhausted all the time.

I had to come to terms with that my RA, neuropathy, pancreatitis with diabetes, and constant swings from depression to anxiety...  all these things were actually a disability and are hindering my ability to function.  

Now, managing my symptoms and making small adjustments to my routines has become my full time job.  I'm not in balance, though, as I don't get angry any more, like, at all.  If I have a problem, I move into problem solving mode.  Not having the anger outlet doesn't help with my anxiety, though, so...

It will get better, though. You have to keep going. Find a DR that listens to you. I am happy to hear you are starting Humira soon. It has been a great medication for me so far, and I hope it gives you relief from your pain too!",11,jp1sagt,,1687404679
Overwhelmed,comment,"I’m a therapist and agree with suggestions that finding someone to talk with could be beneficial. But my first thought was actually wondering if you’re still on prednisone and if that’s having a negative effect on your mood. Some people have really big mood reactions to even small doses. 

It’s natural and normal to have these feelings. It’s hard to cope with pain and having a changing view about the future. It’s also possible that you and your doc will find the right meds for you or that even new meds or other treatment will be discovered that change things in a positive way. None of us can predict the future. My clients who were diagnosed before biologics had a much different experience than those of us diagnosed later.  

Try to find a therapist with experience in treating chronic illness or pain. Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) has been really beneficial for me and several of my clients.",8,jp38zbv,,1687440483

What sorta helped me was Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) to focus on a life worth living. (Also medical cannabis was life changing.) I struggled with: How can a person want to get out of bed if they feel like things are getting overwhelming? I liked how DBT offers skills. Just a thought and maybe there is something better/different out there that would work for you. It is so easy to lose hope when you feel like you need to move a mountain with a spoon.

There are websites at most of the large university sites that will have good information, or the Arthritis.Foundation at www.arthritis.org, and your  rheumatologist should be able to give you  resources too. In other words, learn what you need to know to take an active role when it comes to selecting a new rheumatologist, PCP, counselor, etc. as well as discussing the pros and cons of the biologics, biosimilars, JAK inhibitors, and other DMARDS.

I have a good cry session sometimes and give myself permission to feel sorry for myself. The shower is a good place for that. Gentle yoga class gives me a break from reality.

Overwhelmed,comment,"Seems like most people are making the suggestions I would.

I’ve been having a lot of difficulty with anxiety and depression myself. I’ve been working with therapists and have found some good medication, and I’ve improved a great deal. I have to say I owe some of it to the new medication I started about a month ago. I’m on Orencia after having only mild success with other non-biologic drugs. I think I’ve found the right combo of anti-anxiety drugs, RA drugs, and therapy that I finally feel closer to normal than I have in ages.

I’d also think about removing prednisone from your lineup if that hasn’t already been discussed. One of the potential side effects is mood swings, and I’ve known several people that can’t take it because they become unreasonably angry at the drop of a hat. It doesn’t sound like the drug has been particularly effective for you either.

Lastly, if you’re able to do so, I’d recommend acupuncture and gentle massage. I can’t do it all the time, but it helps greatly when I can. I have to ensure the massage therapist either had knowledge of how to work on those with RA or give them very specific guidelines - no intense pressure (so a 2 on the scale), turn the bed warmer down so I don’t feel like a fried chicken, stay away from massaging the actual joints, etc.

Overwhelmed,comment,"Very well written feelings!  I could have written the same thing at your age 11 years ago.  I was angry for a long time, and I am still angry.  I think you will come to find that you get into the ebbs and flows of the day and you recognize when it is time to slow down, stop, or don’t do.  For me, I was angry because of the delays in treatment, finding a competent doctor and getting timely follow up.  It is something that we have come to expect from healthcare.  It doesn’t make it right and it doesn’t make it easier.  

I am glad you are starting Humira.  I think you are going to find things will turn around now that you have the proper care in place.  I think you are going to find you have good days and bad days.  I think you will learn to recognize the good days and take advantage.  You will realize there are some things that you will never do again, and you will always feel like you are a burden.  

I know this reads like a warning, but I write it as a reality of what you will feel on any given day.  You will have the good days and the bad days to deal with, but it is how you use the good days that will count the most.  Believe me, there will be a lot of good days!  On the good days; go for a walk with family, neglect chores, have company over, whatever makes you feel good.  On the good days, forget about the bad days, even for a moment.

Overwhelmed,comment,"I think one of the greatest disservices to newly diagnosed people is expecting them to just deal with this huge life changing thing. 

Every big diagnosis should come with grief counseling. Period.

You're grieving and angry and hurting. I get that. I think we all do. But you're also grieving the future life you thought you had ahead of you. You haven't had a chance to work that out while also being slammed with this new shitty reality. 

It's a lot. And I hate to be that person, but it will become routine. You'll get used to blood work, doctors, therapies, and even the pain will just become another thing you deal with. Not happily, but it’s part of your life now.

And it's okay to be absolutely pissed off about it. I'm almost 14 years in, and I still get pissed off about it every now and then. If you have the wherewithal, get some help with that anger. I've been in therapy for a while, and while it doesn't do much for the physical crap, it DOES help me to find coping strategies that aren't just raging and lashing out at everyone around me. They didn’t sign up for this either, and taking it out on my people isn't fair to them. 

So go ahead and be rage-y at the Universe/God(s) who dealt you this hand. But try to spare the innocent, including yourself. You deserve that grace, too. You are not just your body, and that lesson took me a long time to learn. The failure of your body does not equate to you are a failure.

big hugs to you. it’s so hard to be young and find out you have a chronic illness. my best advice is start adjusting your life now - there’s no shame in asking for accommodations at school or work, asking your friends and loved ones to help adjust plans to be more accessible for you. find where you’re struggling and adapt - a shower chair, a mobility aid, etc can make a world of difference. 

there is hope. being young means the science will only continue to improve as we grow older with this disease. it’s so fucking hard and sometimes it sucks to have to be brave when you don’t want to be. but there are people out there who get it. 
i’ve ended up seeking therapy to help me through the grief of coping with the diagnosis. we’re framing it as grief counseling so i can productively mourn the life i envisioned for myself, what i’m losing, but also adjust how i’m moving forward and planning my future.

"Those of you who were diagnosed young, is there any hope?",comment,"I was diagnosed at 16, I was put on many medications but the only one that has helped at all is Etanercept.

If you don't have access to that, then a combination of painkillers and heat/ice can help. 

Naproxen, hydroxychloroquine and tylenol was what I found helped the most before I had my injections. 

I have a LOT of pain and stiffness every morning, so I'd recommend using an icepack as soon as you wake up. This might increase the pain but it will help quite a bit with stiffness! 

After icing my painful joints, it helps to exercise the stiff joints. For me, my hands, wrists and ankles that are the worst- so I do stretches for my legs and wrists. 

If you would like me to describe physiotherapy stretches for you with diagrams then I can provide some for you that I received from my physiotherapist! She gave me quite a few for many joints :)

As for my fingers I like to squeeze thick slime. You should be able to find some in walmart/target,  playdough slime works pretty well. 

The whole exercise process is pretty painful but it gets easier as it goes on, and after a while I have mostly full movement back.

Keep moving and doing small exercises throughout the day otherwise you could stiffen up again, exercise is your best friend.

I find that having a heatpack mid day and in the evening can help with pain, but dont put it directly onto your joints as it can promote swelling!! 


Good luck!!!!

Etanercept, Naproxen, Hydroxychloroquine and Tylenol.

Which was my trigger for flares previously. I’d be mostly fine if I didn’t eat it and on the occasions I caved and ate a delicious pastry or something I’d get a flare the next day. 😊

Edit* I am currently on a combo of hydroxychloroquine daily, sulfasalazine daily, MTX once per week, and Humira injections (pen) once per fortnight",3,jo9u11s,,1686863345

Low mood - methotrexate,post,"I was wondering if anyone has had experiences of severe low mood after starting MTX? I’m having dark thoughts and find myself tearful or crying.

I have a history of depression and been taking an SSRI for over 10 years but my mood has been very stable the last few years. 

This last year for me has been rough with illness, hospital stays, death and loss so I don’t know if it’s the fact that it’s Christmas and that time of year and I’m sad about those I’ve lost and won’t be able to celebrate with - if it’s the fact that I don’t feel well physically or if it’s the medication. 

I’m also on sick leave from work because of the RA so have been alone a lot of the time just with my thoughts even though I do try to keep occupied at home with my hobbies during the day.

I’ve been trying to read up on the side effects online but low mood doesn’t seem to be high on the list - if on it at all. 

Thanks for any input.",10,zgad6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/zgad6a/low_mood_methotrexate/,1670530960
Low mood - methotrexate,comment,I have not experienced this at all on MTX and I have been on Prozac for years.  I think this is probably more than a drug related side effect.

Is it mtx that you have to take vitamin D with? I used to have to take super strong vitamin D with it.

That hasn't happened yet with the Simponi Aria yet, but I don't feel that it's all that effective, either. I'm still symptomatic, but the SA might take the edge off.

He said there was a floral imbalance that led to the “bad bacteria” causing inflammation (like what happens in eczema). I was put on low dose doxycycline. Then two years later (2019) it just stopped.

Long remission after getting pregnant at 35 until I got covid in 2020. Full disclosure, I am an RN in acute care. I went back on hydroxychloroquine with my post covid flair (the irony was not lost on me.)
I did fine for about a year and the flairs got more common requiring multiple steroid tapers without relief so I was started on Humira (failed mtx and arava years ago) after recheck of my RF came back just under 400.  It helped for a bit, but then I started having breakthrough symptoms between biweekly injections and insurance wouldn't pay for weekly humira as I don't have an official RA diagnosis (though my doc says I'm ""getting closer"") so now I'm starting enbrel.  I also take a rx dose of naproxen and I am prescribed prn steroids.  I have been trying not to rely on the Prednisone but I can't make a fist in the morning, I have trouble doing basic self care, and now the pain and stiffness is becoming worse in larger joines including my elbows and knees. 
I guess I'm just curious if as needed steroids are commonly prescribed for folks, is this standard practice?  I have had patients on a low daily dose chronically, but not as needed.

Since Covid I've been on steroids more than I have in the previous 10 years. As you may already know, it's the total lifetime dose of steroids that determines your risk of long term side effects. So if you're going thru a hopefully temporary rough period, by all means use the steroids as needed. 

There was a time during the start of my disease when my rheumatologist gently but firmly told me to decrease my as needed use because I was growing too dependent on it. Then I got disseminated Histo on Humira and steroids so I avoided steroids like the plague for 10 years. 

Since getting Covid, my doc has been generous with steroids and when I had a massive overseas vacation planned she offered an Rx of prednisone to take to guarantee I would enjoy my trip.

Can’t afford shit,comment,"Sounds like you're in the US. The healthcare system is so fucking infuriating and inhumane. No one should have to go without maintenance medication. Ever.

Especially when it comes to chronic illness, tying your access to medication so heavily to your income, which is dependent on your ability to work, to be productive and active, is a cruel joke. The sicker you get, the harder it is to afford the medication you need to get better. It's such a perverse and vicious cycle.

And not to mention the ideology of American rugged individualism dictates that not only are you supposed to pull yourselves up by your own bootstraps, you're supposed to do so while your joints are crumbling and your body is screaming in pain. Not happy about it? Well, you're lazy and a dirty communist if you want socialized healthcare.

I hope the US wakes up one day and switches over to some form of single payer or universal healthcare but the outlook still looks bleak. 

I'm very lucky that I moved to Taiwan after college, and we have excellent universal healthcare here. I only developed arthritis a few years ago, and had planned to live here permanently, but now I cannot imagine moving back and having to worry about medical expenses like that. 

I know it's not an option for everyone but I highly recommend moving to a country (like Taiwan) that has universal healthcare if you can. The initial cost to uproot and move might seem high but over the long term, the peace of mind is priceless.

"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",post,"I've had an autoimmune disease (originally thought to be lupus, later changed to an RA diagnosis).  Through treatment changes I've seen a lot of benefit in terms of mobility, ability to walk, fatigue, etc, etc.

Currently I take hydroxycloroquine, 25mg/weekly of MTX, 5mg of prednisolone, 40 mg Humaria every 2 weeks, and Naproxen as needed. The Humaria has greatly reduced the overall joint swelling which has been great. However 2 months in I'm still having pain and soreness in my knees, especially on the sides of the knees when laying down or keeping them straight. I still have morning stiffness that goes away in 1-2 hours.

My rheumatologist suggested switching to Embrel, but I'm worried about switching off Humaria when it works pretty good and it not working if I need to come back to it or if Embrel doesn't end up working.

When should I just consider my treatment regime ""good enough""? Should I just accept the remaining but much reduced amount of pain I have everyday? Have any of you switched back to a biologic you've previously used? What would you personally do in this situation?",13,15f7yni,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/15f7yni/when_should_i_consider_my_treatment_regime_good/,1690883743

I'm now really careful about my steroid use when im on biologics.",7,jucv41y,,1690905236
"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",comment,"Is ""good enough"" kind of like a C average? Or a B+? You see, it's such a hard thing to quantify for another person. I know that for myself, I'm always shooting for a straight A+ with extra credit, but there are so many extenuating circumstances. That   is where my doctors education, experience, and knowledge of my health history and the drugs come in. But you asked for advice, and now that my soapbox is done, I will say a few things, then tell you what I think.

The prednisolone is not a good drug to be on in the long term because it's hard on our bones. It can cause osteoporosis and adrenal insufficiency over several years of use, so if it was me, I would ask to be tapered off of it ASAP. Except for the Naprosyn, everything else you're taking mirror's my meds and a lot of other people's. If I wasn't happy with my treatment, I would switch to what my doctor suggested. Remember, Humira and Enbrel, while great, aren't the only biologics out there. If you did switch, and you were no better off on Enbrel, there are literally dozens of other biologics out there. You're never locked into a medication as long as your insurance will approve it.

Edited to say my biologic is Orencia, not Enbrel or Humira.

tldr; Edit 2: My comments about prednisolone are my own interpretations of what I've either read online and in drug literature or experienced in my own life. I don't want to appear to be giving you medical advice, which my pred comment certainly sounds to be.

"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",comment,"Enbrel got me back to 90% of old me almost overnight. Now I still have some flare ups but mostly swelling in my knees and ankles. Before enbrel, flare ups meant I couldn't get out of bed or I would stop in my tracks and cry due to the pain.

I can say that enbrel saved my life. Now I am looking into some different types of workouts to help improve my flexibility and lose a couple of pounds to help me as I get older.

Due to the improvement from enbrel, I sometimes over exert myself and end up being very sore the next day. It has been 5 yrs since my RA diagnosis but showing symptoms years before writing pain off to working too hard. 

Now as a 44 y/o man, I have to come to terms that meds are only going to get me so far so I am trying to focus on eating better, start working out and focus on my mental health. 

Pain and I have been well aquinted for years but it was the mental toll from RA that I wasn't prepared to handle and still have difficulty handling. I have trouble with the fact that my body will tell me i can't do things i used to be able to do just a few years ago. The physical symptoms are what we always talk about first because they are glaringly obvious but make sure to work on your mental health as well because redefining what good enough is in our minds will make a dramatic impact on our well-being. 

Please don't read this as some type of lecture. Just wanted to offer some advice from my personal experience. Doctors just tell us their medical opinions but being able to share with people actually going through the same things really helps. For me personally, I wish I found this sub sooner.",5,juca7f5,,1690896959

"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",comment,"Hi, don't settle for good enough. It takes some time to find the right meds that work for you. 

For one thing, you might want to ask your doc to take Humira every week instead of two since you have had decent results. You will have to stop; the mTx, though.

It takes some time for meds to build up in your system. It's been two months? Give it one more month for max benefit, and if it doesn't improve, switch. 

One time. I was taking a med Simponi that was working, or so I thought, but due to a weird side effect, I was switched to Humira, and it worked better than the last. 

I hesitated because it was the best I had felt in a long while. Ultimately, I am grateful for the side effect because now I'm at 90% better. That's after several years of trial and error. 

It can happen finding the right med. When a doc finds the class of meds that helps you, which seems like TNF blockers help somewhat, it's easier to find that one.  
Take care, hope you get relief soon.",2,juehw5k,,1690927200
"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",comment,"I just want to say- you aren't alone. I'm 13 years into having RA, and 4 years into my biologic journey and I still wonder the same thing often. How good is ""good enough""? I think it's very subjective though, and depends on what you realistically want to be doing with you life. You can't compare your life expectations or goals now to your pre-RA goals and expectations because your body is different now. Don't give up on your goals, but allow yourself to adjust them. For example, I used to love camping, hiking, biking, anything active. I know that my old activity levels are unrealistic now, but I can still strive to be moderately active and do meaningful activity. Currently my disease isn't controlled enough to be as active as I want, so I've shared these goals with my rheum and we are working together to find a way to get me there.",2,jv3xqw9,,1691374342
"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",comment,Never. Keep  nudging until you are out of pain. It's different for all.of us.

"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",comment,"That’s a pretty personal question so it’s tough to answer for another person. Personally I would give the humira a bit more time to see if it decreases your knee pain/swelling more. 
It took me over a year of adjusting my treatment before I had many good days. I took methotrexate for over a year will decent effect, but after adding Enbrel injections weekly I was able to go into remission.",1,juexwiz,,1690933897

A few months ago I couldn't get my syringes so I ended up on a 3 week mtx holiday. That's when I learned how good that combo was working 😄 it also threw me into a major dysorotic Eczema flair. I've now had my mtx for 3 weeks and the question is... Is this good enough or should I go to the next medicine.

Since then I haven't had as good of a response to the other two I have tried now. Unfortunately, here in Canada, our insurance is very very picky about biologic usage and once you say it's not working well enough for you they won't generally allow you back onto it.

"When should I consider my treatment regime ""good enough""",comment,"If am being honest, it is easier to say then to put into practice. I am a stubborn person so in the beginning it was more difficult because I felt like I was given in to defeat. Now I just ask myself is this task so important to do for me feel like crap later that day or the next? Or can I get it done in small steps I stead of all at once? For example, I have a decent size front/backyard and would cut it all in like an hour and half including the edging and weed whipping. Now, I do just the front yard one day, maybe wait a day and do the back. It all still gets done just in a different time frame.

Will i have my hands back?,post,"Hi all. Its been 3 months since i was diagnosed. Started with plaquenil first then MTX was added a month later and now, sulfasalazine a week ago. 

Joints affected were knees and wrists fingers.

I had my knees drained 2 weeks ago and shots were also given. I feel great cos i can stand up straight and walk now in the mornings! But my wrists are stubborn af. Been having the sausage finger since. Swelling and pain goes down a bit with prednisone but does not completely eliminate it.

Was wondering what your experience is? Especially with people whose hands are affected. It sucks! I can barely do any task without pain. :( hope to hear some positive stories.

Will i have my hands back?,comment,"I don't have my hands back fully, but they are definitely improving.

I was having days where stairs were really hard, and I haven't had that in months. 

It's hard, because the meds all take a while to kick in, and sometimes the improvement is so incremental it's hard to track on a shorter scale.

Will i have my hands back?,comment,"I have significant hand/wrist involvement, plus tfcc tears on both sides and tenosynovitis and some other stuff. I have SO much going on in my wrists and hands, both arthritis and injury-related, and they are really bad. But I also work with my hands and need to be able to make fine movements. I also have PsA. When my meds are working, I’m great. Worst case is some stiffness, a smidge of pain, but then once I get going, I’m totally fine. When my meds are not working, or like right now, I’m flaring while transitioning from one biologic to another, I’m a wreck. I need steroid injections more frequently, and short-course oral steroids. My work is impacted, but with the steroids, it’s not terrible. So for me, absolute worst case is flare with an increase in stiffness/pain, decrease in range of motion, but I take steroids and am still able to function. It’s not terrible, and flares of this severity don’t happen that often for me. I think this is my third *really bad* flare in the last 8 years. My not-a-doctor opinion is the stuff that’s most debilitating/prohibitive is the permanent damage to the joints and surrounding areas. All the other stuff like swelling, stiffness, all the ‘itis-es, etc., are all helped tremendously by oral steroids as needed.  As long as you’re being treated aggressively, the goal/hope is that permanent damage will not occur, and you’ll never get to that point of complete loss of functioning. And it sounds like your rheum is being pretty aggressive. You can also ask for steroid injections in the wrists; these help me SO much.

Will i have my hands back?,comment,"3 years ago, before I got my diagnosis, I was very much into yoga. I’ve been doing it since 1977.  I still can’t do a downward dog or the sun salutation sequence.  At least I can’t do it the way I used to.  I do a modified version of it now.  I only do what I can do and I listen to my body.  

I found some chair yoga videos on YouTube.  

When my hands are in a flare, I avoid doing anything that hurts.  So the yoga I do today is nowhere near the yoga I was doing before I was diagnosed.  But something is better than nothing.


I figure I’m in constant pain whether I’m sitting or sleeping or standing or moving around. So I may as well move. It all hurts. It all hurts a lot.   So I might as well do something that’s healing.  I might as well move.  That hurts just as much as everything else.  But it’s better than just sitting.

Plus, I’ve noticed if I do gentle stretching yoga in the morning, I’m able to move much better throughout the day. I notice a difference if I skip it.

That’s been my experience. 

Maybe find some movement you enjoy. Just know you’ll need to modify & listen to you body (like you have a choice, right??)

But when I got my cartilage and second lobe piercings, I was given Saline spray to clean my ear and I had consistent piercing infections for about five years and took them out multiple times forcing me to get my piercings re-pierced. The last time I had my second lobe piercings re-pierced, I decided to clean my ear less because I actually used to wash my ears every shower. I rinsed them instead and suddenly the piercing infections became a lot less severe to the point I barely had them. Then I got my diagnosis after.

I switched to a stud with butterfly-back. The stud did far better, but still irritated the piercing because it was incorrect. As soon as I got a flat-back labret this February, my helix fully healed within two weeks. My lobes took a little bit longer than the average person, maybe 8 months. I’ve had my nose pierced for 7 years now, and healing went fine, I have had no problems with it.

I’ve also gotten two tattoos, my first healed beautifully. My second healed fine, but it’s in a bad spot as I tend to get acne on my shoulder. The lines are gone in a few very tiny areas, but are not noticeable to others.

Looking for advise on how to deal with RA.,post,"Long story short. Recently diagnosed with RA. Med today a cortisone, which I'm tapering off, now down to 10mg per day and now 3 weeks in on MTX (dosage slowly going up.)

I wouldnt say my pain is unbearable, however hands feet and knees are constantly aching at some point, and doesn't help that is seems like a bloody tag team.

I've returned to work last week, (1st and 2nd fix builder.) Though I can perform my duties, when I get home, I'm just crawling into bed (7pm)

I feel like I'm being a baby, as everyone says pain is normal when you get older. However 6 months ago, I was fine, riding bmx, doing backflips. So as you can imagine, this is pissing me off.

Am I just being overly sensitive? What to do and how do you deal with this?",11,16w3lcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16w3lcp/looking_for_advise_on_how_to_deal_with_ra/,1696070337
Looking for advise on how to deal with RA.,comment,"You are NOT acting like a baby. You've unfortunately been given some tough shit to live with, and I'm sorry that you're joining our club. I assume you're seeing a rheumatologist and am wondering if you've started taking any DMARDS yet. After you can get an effective med or combo of meds that work for you, you will begin to feel better. Getting on the right meds can take considerable time, though, sometimes many months since they don't usually help for weeks to months.

So, try to have patience, maybe some psychotherapy might be helpful as you adjust to living a very different life, and hang in there and keep the faith, knowing that easier days are ahead. Please keep us posted on how you're doing. 🙂",6,k2uv6ir,,1696078247
Looking for advise on how to deal with RA.,comment,"What others have said, you’re not being a baby and you’re not being overly sensitive. However, your body is being overly sensitive and unfortunately that’s pretty normal with RA and other chronic severe pain conditions. I was just talking to my rheumatologist about this, how my pain responses are outsized to the injury. For example, today I was going out the door to take my puppy for a walk. He got overexcited and charged out, and snapped his leash against 3 of my knuckles and bent my thumbnail backwards. I was doubled over in pain for a good 5 minutes. For the record, I have a typically very high pain tolerance, but with this disease, my nerves are on rapid fire and holy $h1t does anything to do with my hands hurt. 

If it’s an option where you are, I highly recommend visiting a pain clinic. The one I go to mostly caters to cancer patients, which makes me feel like a baby sometimes, but they never treat me that way. They approach chronic pain from 3 sides, so I see a medical doctor, a physical therapist, and a mental health therapist. The medical doctor is managing my pain meds, while the physical therapist gives me targeted stretches and exercises and helps me reset my expectations, and the mental health therapist helps give me coping strategies. One of the most helpful things I’ve learned is that my body is currently primed to feel pain with exercise because I keep pushing myself to try to do as much as I could before. So I have to back way off, and find the threshold where I can exercise without pain and let my body relearn how to do that. Then I can start increasing the exercise a little at a time.",4,k2yyhu1,,1696144183
Looking for advise on how to deal with RA.,comment,"It’s a journey and important to learn what you can control, and what you can’t. You absolutely have to put your health up front in order to then get the most you can. Starting out with MTX is standard as insurance will demand it before investing in the next steps. But be honest with your rheumatologist (and get one if you don’t have one) and advocate for your health. If something isn’t working then push for the next thing.
There are lots of reports saying nutrition does or doesn’t help. Eating healthy is the bottom line so your body can focus on healing rather than dealing with another thing on top of the RA.
There will be days where you feel like you’ve done everything “right”: food, sleep, no alcohol, light workouts, stress controlled, and the m’fkr will still kick your ass because RA does what RA wants and when it wants. But don’t help it kick your ass.
You can keep doing the things you love but have to recognize you may have to do them differently or for a shorter duration. 
Don’t give up though; it’s just a new way of living and the positives are it forces you to make much ether choices for your body and mental health, so hang in there and never feel bad about how you feel!",3,k2vxfrb,,1696094045

Looking for advise on how to deal with RA.,comment,"For me, I was barely able to walk or use my hands when the mofo of flares hit like a truck. Ended up in an urgent care and so the process began. I found the diagnosis a relief in an odd way because I finally had an answer and options.

Took a few months before I was feeling better. I did everything I could - cut out sugar and gluten, got on a nutritional program and just kept fighting. My roommate is the official jar opener. I couldn't easily drive because of my hands, but I'm back at it.

Extremely important that you have help and someone to talk to because this doesn't go away but there are amazing treatments available that will help you.  

You're not a crybaby; you're fighting a horrible disease that is relentless. Fortunately, it can be bitch slapped to slow down or even stopped with medical treatment.

Educate yourself as much as possible and work with your doctor and others. This is learning how to manage it.

I did a 180 and shifted to putting my health as a priority. Am able to stay home to work so that was a huge relief.

How long did it take for Methotrexate to work?,comment,"Hard to say because I started methotrexate with regular, pretty high prednisone: after 8 weeks we added hydroxychloroquine, then 6 weeks later leflunomide. At around 5 months added Hadlima (adalumimab variant). Bang! Magic bullet.   
A week later I dialed down, and after 4 weeks, just stopped the prednisone. After 3 months I dumped the leflunomide.   
6 months into the biologic I've now reduced the methotrexate dose.   
Can't say yet whether methotrexate had no effect, but it definitely didn't do it by itself.  The rheumy doesn't want to stop it in one feel swoop in case it turns out that it is part of the solution.   
The only side effect of all of those was a little hair thinning that recovered once I was off the leflunomide.   
It was really frustrating not seeing a solution (not just the pain, but knowing the damage was ongoing all that time) bit maybe the result was that much sweeter because of it.

Have a bit of pain still but manageable. I do have OA and a tendency to get bursitis as well as the RA.",10,juhmswy,,1690988101

Orencia?,comment,"Hi! Here's the order of biologics I've been on (all alongside MTX) over the last 20 years:   
Enbrel ---> Remicaide --> Orencia --> Actemra --> Xeljanz  


Orencia worked great until mid-pandemic when we believe my body started creating antibodies to it. My doc explained that the mechanism of Orencia in particular sometimes works for people who aren't responding to the other meds.My doc did explain the downsides of Xeljanz heart / vascular wise but she said it's MUCH more common in people over 60 and wasn't particularly concerned for my age (41).

Best of luck to yu!",3,juhojdn,,1690988779

Orencia?,comment,"When I started Orencia my doctor said his experience with patients using it was that it either worked well or not at all. If I understand correctly, this is due to the specific proteins it targets and whether the patient had them or not.  It’s working well for me, along with MTX.

Orencia?,comment,"Orencia was very helpful for a period for my joint pain, swelling, redness, but most notable side effects I couldn’t quite bare: stomach swelling that looked like I was 8 mths pregnant (no stomach upset, just tenderness and swelling), I gained about 15-20 pounds in just 1 month that hasn’t come off and continues even months after stopping (gained it in weird places I never have before, I’m normally in the 115-120 pound range my whole life - like I just look so doughy with complete loss of muscle mass despite exercise/weight training), crushing exhaustion, and lost half my head of hair.

Questions for people that have had RA for a long time.,post,"I was diagnosed 2.5 years ago, when I was only having symptoms in my hands (mainly my right hand, the dominant one.) I'd recently had carpal tunnel release surgery, first in my left one, then my right one. When I still had intense pain, swelling, and decreased range of motion in my right wrist even after my recovery period and physical therapy, they decided to do an MRI and run blood tests and finally determined I had seropositive RA. 

MTX was a fail, but Humira was managing my disease REALLY well up until a couple months ago. Recently I've been having mild-moderate pain on and off in other joints, including my left hand/wrist and my elbows, shoulders, hips, and ankles. I've also started having hand tremors, especially with certain wrist positions. I have an appt with a Neurologist next week (mainly for chronic migraines, but also to discuss the tremors) and a new Rheumatologist in May, and I'm going to discuss switching to a different biologic at that time.

Now, to my questions for long term RA people: How quickly did things progress for you, even with being on medication? What was your progression like, and what have you done to manage it? How has it affected your career, and what careers have you found that work for you and your mental and physical health? I'm a Registered Vet Tech going on 8 years, but it's getting harder and harder and I'm trying to decide when/if I need to leave the field.

Questions for people that have had RA for a long time.,comment,"Hey, I'll give you my story below, but just a word of caution that autoimmune diseases and the drugs that treat them are really particular and very wildly person to person. So anecdotally, you are going to get a big range of experiences.

I was diagnosed with JRA at 9 years old. Nowadays they would diagnose me as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and technically that's my current diagnosis despite being an adult. It's the same doctor in the same treatment as rheumatoid arthritis, it's just that I was diagnosed young and presentations a little weird (idiopathic).

My earliest memories were wondering why I couldn't do things like other kids, and I had a marked period of lethargé, then had issues with walked and could not get out of bed. What's my parents got me to a pediatrician, diagnosis was then pretty swift.

I was brought under control with prednisone, then started methotrexate. I responded really well to methotrexate and naproxen. I still have some limitations as a kid, but most of them and outside observer wouldn't notice unless I told them.

In my late teens to mid twenties I was in clinical remission, but was not surprised when it came back. I had chosen a profession pretty rough on my joints - a trained chef, but I was pretty fed up with that profession anyway at the time that it was starting to become impossible for my body. I went back to school and work in supply chain. It does job still has some issues for me where I really had to be serious about ergonomics, I develop tendonitis and bursitis really easily. My rheumatologist says that inflammation begets more inflammation, so if you have joint inflammation it's pretty easy for that to jump to tendons and bursa. Stress is my number one trigger though, so I have transitioned to a job that is pretty light on the stress and flexible in the hours but I appreciate not everybody has this opportunity.

Managing stress is really important, trying to stay healthy helps a lot too but is not a magic bullet. I eat well and try to keep my weight under control. I try to stay active, but it's hard as doing things to vigorous just causes more problems, but what's defined as ""too vigorous"" changes all the time. Little bouts everyday of swimming, stretching and walking seem to work best for me.

And still, most people wouldn't know I have a chronic illness unless I told them. They live in mostly normal life, but as I get older (38now) I am more tired and developing new problems, so we will see what the future holds.",12,jej5t33,,1680353982
Questions for people that have had RA for a long time.,comment,"I was diagnosed at 18 months old, had developmental issues with walking etc but from memory was only ever on high dose ibuprofen as treatment. From around 3-12 I had no real symptoms. Then I tore ligaments and cartilage in my knee which had knock on issues. Teens and early twenties I would have frequent flares and immobility in my knees.

Early twenties I started MTX, nó real issues/side effects from it and progression of disease is non existent. No new joints affected since I started MTX and flares are v minor and far between.

Due to covid and moving house I haven't had any active rheumatology monitoring since about 2018 but have an appointment next week so I guess we'll see if anything has been happening behind the scenes so to speak.

Career wise I'm an ecologist, so was outdoors doing wildlife surveys for around 8 years, lots of walking and driving. Would take painkillers if I had a particularly heavy day but other than time off for regular Dr's appointments it's had no effect on me. I am now mainly (home) office based (due to career progression) and if anything I find this more difficult than the outdoor work. A lot better since using a standing desk.

Questions for people that have had RA for a long time.,comment,"My first question to you, did you stop humira for any time? Many biologics stop working if stop treatment.  I went through 3 of them so far because of that.",3,jejmywz,,1680362155
Questions for people that have had RA for a long time.,comment,"Have you tried a steroid pack to see if that knocks out residual inflammation and then humira can maintain the status quo? I had a flare for the first time in 18 months on humira - it was like deja vu and I knew exactly what it is, all of my joints just hurt and felt achy - within a couple weeks I got a steroid pack and everything went back to normal, and stayed that way. You really don't want to bounce around to different biologics without making sure it's for sure not working. 

FWIW, I have had RA for 4 years and I am exactly as functional as I was prior to diagnosis. With appropriate meds, I don't expect any permanent damage that would limit my ability to work or exercise.",2,jem3wvr,,1680402251
Questions for people that have had RA for a long time.,comment,"I’ve had RA since I was about 11 or 12, I’m almost 26 now. In the time that I’ve had it, my disease has worsened about 75% in just the last 3 years.

I look back and think that I was far luckier than I realized, even though I was so grateful I wasn’t in a wheelchair yet. My whole body was affected, I had regular flare ups, I got tired more quickly, and I had to watch my exertion and plan ahead. But I still lived a somewhat normal teenage life. I still went to school when I felt awful, but I still missed a few days. I tore a ligament in my knee, still don’t know how because I never did anything crazy, I think it just had enough.

I didn’t have any treatment or a Rheumatologist until I was 19, started methotrexate and it was working for a while. I had to stop taking it last year due to my liver flaring up. I tried Enbrel, but it gave me worsening skin reactions with each injection for 5 weeks when we stopped. I was on Orencia last year, but it wasn’t doing anything. I’m starting Actemra infusions in May, hoping it helps.

The last 3 years (starting before COVID hit), my body has gone downhill. I don’t work, I’m home all day. I’m in constant pain, I’ve lost a lot of range of motion in my hands, elbows, and shoulders. I have nerve issues that we are trying to diagnose. I need help getting up and down from the toilet, I can’t climb stairs almost at all. I haven’t showered myself more than a handful of times in the last 3 years. I’m still able to walk, but not very well. I would use a rollator, but my living situation is too tiny for that. I’ve lost 70 pounds, and I’m trying to gain half of it back. I haven’t prepared my own food since last August, I can’t wash dishes.

I went dress shopping for my best friend’s wedding the other day, could barely drive myself home because of the pain, and spent the next day in bed paying for it.

Ra patients are at a 50% risk of developing fibromyalgia covid may accelerate that. Fibromyalgia can oftentimes feel very similar to ra. Autoimmunity travels in packs, you have one there is a high likability you have or will have another one.

 I got diagnosed with jra at age 2, i am 43 now. Over the past 10 years i have been diagnosed with sjogrens, fibromyalgia and environmental and food allergies/possible mast cell activation. 
Switching my gp to a functional medicine practitioner i now know that i most likely had those secondary autoimmunities all along but undiagnosed.

So talk to your doctor about switching you to another biologic like embrel or orencia and see if one of them starts working. Also talk to them about other diagnosis that would fit the new arising symptom you are experiencing.",3,jejra3c,,1680363968

Methotrexate worked for me after 4-5 months. I learned to take it in the evening after dinner. It worked best if I ate dinner that included some carbohydrates. Plan to take it easy the next day. Folic acid is usually recommended because it prevents mouth and nose sores.

What to expect from MTX,comment,"Yes, while you can search for the answers, I think this is a topic I wouldn’t mind typing out my own response again and again.
I’ve now been 4 months in, and on the 3rd month, in combination with prednisolone, I felt the pain reduction significantly enough to begin tapering the prednisolone. I’m now about 2 months into a mono therapy of MTX only. I was seronegative and had inflammation and synovitis in my wrists and thumbs on both hands. 

I won’t say I’m completely free of pain, that level of pain free-ness is not constant. But I am at a place where I can do many normal things, and stay active and work. 

As for side effects I feel almost nothing. I take it on a Wednesday night, I do feel a bit tired on Friday but that’s just work life I guess. I still run and cycle for 30 mins on Friday.

I do take folic acid everyday. Hopefully it will work for you like it has for me. I take it easy the next day but in reality when I take methotrexate I usually get up early the next morning feeling fine. Doctors in the United States will tell you you can't drink on it at all however I have doctors from Europe that tell me I can drink on it ......so what I've done is take the half-life multiply it times 6 which basically gives you two full days after taking it before most has been processed through your liver..  then I can moderately drink alcohol however you have to make sure to do lab work constantly if you do that.

How to deal with the blues?,post,"My wife was diagnosed with RA a few months ago - her doctor started her off with a course of steroid tablets, which seemed to help, and then moved her onto Methotrexate. Before the diagnosis, she was in a lot of pain, but her spirit was good and she made a huge effort to keep doing things (with my help). Now she's on MTX (is that the correct abbreviation?) she's in less pain, but her spirit has hit the floor. Is this a common thing with MTX treatment, or is it psychological, because of what she's going through? She's not keen on seeking mental health treatment, but I think she might need it. 

Any advice?

How to deal with the blues?,comment,"I am in remission with MTX. There’s such a tremendous psychological aspect to this disease. You really go through a grieving process. Since you are recognizing this in your wife, if she doesn’t already know, tell her that you’re there for her when she wants to talk. That is so helpful. But grieving takes time.

How to deal with the blues?,comment,"MTX is the correct abbreviation, yes. 

Unfortunately, yes - depression is pretty common with autoimmune diseases as well as chronic illness/chronic pain conditions.

How to deal with the blues?,comment,"I have no experience with this medication,but plenty experience with feeling terrible. For me the bottom line is simple: when you feel happy, be happy, when you feel sad, be sad. Life has its ups and downs, trust the process.

That said, it does generally help to take good care of yourself. So make sure to get enough regular sleep, eat healthy, exercise, meditate and above all, listen to your body. If your body tells you that you really need to rest, do that.

Stress is a huge factor when it comes to depression, pain and physical and mental health in general. I personally spend a lot of time reducing stress. That can be through meditation, philosophy, music, what people I hang out with, what sort of work I do for a living, etc.. There's a lot you can do with that.",11,iywg64z,,1670178597
How to deal with the blues?,comment,"Dealing with RA is extremely emotionally draining. Juggling all the doctors, meds, medical terminology, appointments, dealing with pain, fears, etc. 

Try to support your wife as best you can; having RA can feel very isolating. Keep up with her diagnoses, meds, and progress so she can have someone who’s not a doctor to talk/vent about it with. Suggest fun things to do (together or on her own) that will lift her spirits but won’t be too taxing on her inflamed joints - for example if inflammation is limited to her hands/arms y’all could go hiking, or if it’s limited to her knees/legs y’all could do a seated painting class together. Swimming is good because buoyancy takes weight off all joints and exercises them. But the activities could be anything. 

Also eating healthy, fresh foods can make a world of a difference when it comes to inflammation.",12,iywskhu,,1670183284

How to deal with the blues?,comment,"Like what others are saying, when you’re processing the fact that you have an illness and there’s no cure.. it’s a lot. My dad got his diagnosis almost 10 years ago for RA. I saw him dealing with the emotional weight of it all but I never understood it until I got my diagnosis 2 years ago. He walked into my room with me laying on the floor mourning my health. I was mourning the fact that I was in my late 20s and dealing with this, that I couldn’t be there with my kids like I was before, I was exhausted all the time, and I was struggling with basic things because I’m in constant pain. I felt like my future was so uncertain because of this illness. He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, “I know… I’m sorry.” 

Definitely recommend finding a therapist, but also finding a community with others who go through their own chronic illness battles. I’m not one to really want to talk much so I follow some people on TikTok and I also read blogs about others who are dealing with the same stuff I am. It helped me feel less alone. It helped validate my feelings and I learned some different ways to help when I’m in a flare.",6,iyyekij,,1670207815

I finally contacted a therapist because I felt pretty helpless on how to feel better. And having someone who knows chronic pain has been an amazing grieving outlet. I expected her to kind of lift me up and help me think more positively, etc. But she’s actually really made me face the diagnosis and what it means and all the things I feel like I’m losing head on and give me space with her to process it. I would not have guessed this is what I needed—it sounds depressing! But it’s helped me have that time and place to be very sad about it and then learn some tools to work through it on my own as well. 

You’re amazing for asking—this is a really lonely journey and recognizing the gravity of it for your partner goes a long way. ❤️ I really hope she starts feeling better soon.",7,iyxt188,,1670197923
How to deal with the blues?,comment,"I was out in MTX right after diagnosis. My reaction was more.physcial with lots of nausea. MTX is rough so just let her know she's not crazy for feeling bad. Moving is always the best medicine. I found stretching in the morning super helpful. Also my doctor said I could split the MTX over to 2 days to help with the nausea. She should tell her doctor who may have other options for her.

Good luck. It can get better. I am now off MTX and only on Humira.",4,iywgzbd,,1670178901
How to deal with the blues?,comment,"Give it time. I’m 1.5 years into my diagnosis and am just starting to come out of the “hitting a wall of depression” phase.

I was diagnosed super young (I’m 31 now). RA is a lifelong, incurable autoimmune disorder that is specific to each individual. Not only do you have to wrap your head around the chronic pain management and medication, you have to mentally redefine yourself as someone who has a lifelong diagnosis that will have ups and downs, and you just don’t always know what will trigger the ups or downs. It’s a process of building resilience and accepting life as it comes.

I think a good tip for you as the non-diagnosed partner is to balance cheerful positivity and being a non-advice-giving sounding board, haha. Sometimes I really just want to complain or cry to my partner without judgement or having to look at “the bright side.” That being said, your partners body/life is changing, but it’s not a death sentence! Find the humor but let her determine her own journey through it. Some things she loves might become impossible depending on her condition - let her set the pace and tone, but be there to support if needed.

No one has the answers here. Just stay patient with each other and yourselves, and remember that you also deserve time for some fun/hobbies/enjoying life, even when your partner is going through it. Take care of yourself too, it sounds like you’re an attentive and thoughtful person to be going through this with!",7,iyx2lnq,,1670187049
How to deal with the blues?,comment,"I was diagnosed in the fall of 2021 and have been on MTX ever since. My body tolerates the tablets well, but if your wife continues to experience nausea with them she can ask her rheumy to switch her to the injectable version. My friend did that and found it helped a lot.

When your wife needs to vent to you, ask her if she's solution-oriented and help her with that if she is. If she's not looking for help and just needs to get stuff off her chest, let her, without interruption or judgment or ""helpful"" advice. Listen and nod.

Encourage your wife to see a therapist. Do you know why she doesn't want to? I would look for a therapist that has experience counseling people who have chronic illnesses/chronic pain.

Biologic fears,post,"Hello, all!

I've been in need of a biologic for like 5 years, as I'm considered severe even with injected mtx and several tries with plaquenil and sulfasalazine. 

I have a very high family history of heart disease in my family. Intensely high. Cancer also runs heavy as well.

They want me on Actemra. I am just quite scared to go on any of them, because of the side effects. I've been putting it off for all these years and still come to the same conclusion.

My rheumy doesn't recommend Xeljanz because it doesn't have a long enough track record on the books. I really don't want to do infusions. My panic disorder has the same symptoms as an allergic reaction and I think sitting overthinking would cause me to spike. So I'd want an auto injector or a pill.
I also have some organ involvement so the pill/meds also worry me there with filtering it.

I know everyone reacts differently. That either way, the potential for a shorter life span is likely.


I just looking for people who might be able to relate and/or have any food for thought.

My best to you all!",3,12ctaxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/12ctaxj/biologic_fears/,1680719113
Biologic fears,comment,"Ok here is my experience as I have been on several of these meds:

Remicade (infusions): If you can handle blood work you can do infusions. Once a month at  a hospital for several hours is annoying but it’s a miracle in a bag and I definitely felt the difference walking in vs walking out. The whole time you are in a place that can immediately attend to your needs if there was to be a medical emergency, which is very rare. I think even with anxiety and thinking about the worst case scenario, it’s hard to not take solace in the fact that you are in exactly the right place of an emergency we’re to occur. A whole team of trained professionals at a moments notice. And once you’re all out there is practically no risk of anything drastic occurring. 

I was on remicade for several years and the worst thing that happened was sometimes the IV would be itchy, I tell the nurse, she slows the infusion down, itching goes away. Also liked that the nurses could do blood work and IV in one poke! 

Embrel: Self injections created a lot of anxiety for me. These days I think they improved the formula so it doesn’t sting as much anymore. When I was on them it stung so bad and I had to hold it for at least 10 seconds on my leg. Awful. I kept skipping dieses and after a panic attack I told my rheumatologist I can’t do this anymore. Medication did work though, but bad fit for me. 

Xeljanz: It is a newer medication and the long term effects aren’t as well known as the other medications. I have been on it for 7 years and love it, but I get the risks and that not everyone is comfortable with them. The once a day pill medications are the least hassle with the same potency as the other medications. 

Side effect lists for medications: most side effects are not likely, in studies any time the participants have anything that could be side effect it has to be reported. So most lists are long and scary but the majority of the side effects are likely not caused by the medication itself. For many medications there are probably 2-3 key risks that are actually worthy of concern, and a doctor can help walk you through those risks in relation to your medical history. But if they want you to take a medication they are recommending it because they thing the risks outweigh the benefits, otherwise they wouldn’t make the recommendation at all.",8,jf38t3v,,1680722138
Biologic fears,comment,"I’m currently on Actemra. Side effects have been minimal. Sometimes I feel a little hot. That’s all. Been on it 18 months. It’s worked really well. I take it as an auto-injector every other week. No infusion. 

I’ve also been on Humira and Enbrel in the past. Was briefly on xeljanz but it raised my liver levels so the doctor told me to stop it. 

I’ve been on methotrexate in the past, and frankly that one gave me the worst side effects. Nausea for two days each week I took it. Felt horrible. I feel like it’s side effects are worse than the biologics. 

Humira gave me some weird nerve sensations. I was fine on it bi-weekly, but then had to up to once a week and had some weird sensations on the side of my head. 

I would also recommend you try to be as healthy as possible, just to limit the chances of things like heart disease/cancer. Also try to exercise if you can. I love bikram yoga and it helps with RA too. Good luck with what you decide to do",3,jf3cs1w,,1680723620

Biologic fears,comment,"I can understand your hesitation over side effects, particularly with your family history.

As soon as I started Actemra, my inflammatory markers came down immediately (I take 1 pre-filled syringe a week). I felt significantly better, although I still have pain.

Biologic fears,comment,"Hold up - your rheumy is saying Xeljanz doesn't have a long enough track record? It was approved back in 2012. 

My thought is  - How are you being treated for your panic disorder? Stress is likely complicating your RA horribly. 

As RA patients, we already have higher than normal cancer rates - double in fact. Which means, without treatment we are looking at some very horrifying statistics. This increased risk is from unchecked inflammation. 

The overall cancer risk for patients on biologics was less than 4% (averaged). When compared to DMARD, there was no increased risk. 

Compare each drug's increased risk for cancer vs the placebo group and you often find there is NO increased risk at all, given the already higher than average RA/cancer comorbidity risk when adjusted for treatment.",1,jf3pc6e,,1680728305

How did your hydroxychloroquine stomach issues manifest? And a little rant…,post,"First time posting in this community that has become my lifeline recently ❤️. 

TLDR, I am in the throes right now and feeling way too sorry for myself - think I may be having a bad reaction to HQN but not sure where to place the blame. 

I’m seropositive, 36F, and finally got myself on the medication train after a bout of denial/fear and a bad experience with MTX. I started hydroxychloroquine almost a month ago, plus a run of prednisone because I was in such a bad flare. The first few days I had the common HQN diarrhea issues but then it calmed down. Now I’m at the end of a trip with my husband/family to Europe right now (obviously very lucky). It’s my first time really traveling with active disease, and it started off ok until I had to start tapering of the pred and then got hit with Covid. I’ve been isolating from everyone and in bed with a fever for 4 days, but the last few days I’ve also developed GI issues like I haven’t had in many years, and also some minor rashes and itching. Anything I eat goes straight through me, no matter what it is. I’ve heard issues with this drug can show up on a delay and was wondering if anyone has a similar experience... 

I will definitely talk to my doctor about this when I get home - he’s just impossible to get a hold of even when we’re in the same time zone.

Newly diagnosed with RA,comment,"First - I'm sorry about your diagnosis. RA is complicated and terrifying. Obviously nothing can cure RA, but methotrexate is typically the first treatment after diagnosis. Everyone is different - there are lots of people who tolerate mtx just fine! It really helps with their symptoms and their joint damage is slowed. Others (like me) don't do as well. My liver was starting to have issues, so I moved on to biologics. A few starter tips from my experience: take mtx at night to avoid initial nausea. Start when you have a day to see how you tolerate it. As you titrate up you might have new or worse side effects. Tell your rheumy! Keep them in the loop with any thoughts or concerns. This isn't an allergy pill - they're going to expect questions. You might find the side effects lessen over time. It's good to keep track of your pain in general (helps your rheumy to better understand your RA) and how you're doing with mtx. I hope it goes well? Mtx can absolutely slow the disease.

I follow a Mediterranean diet - lots of fresh veg and fruit, fish,  chicken. It means I have to cook a lot but is worth it. And I take some extra supplements,  multi vitamin,  B, D, magnesium.  You may want to start treatment first then experiment to see what dietary changes you find helpful. I was on methotrexate for several years and it worked fine for me with minimal side effects until the effectiveness wore off and I switched to biologics. Be sure your Rheumatologist discusses a folic acid supplement to take with the methotrexate.  Best of luck!",5,k3bxp2e,,1696363719
Newly diagnosed with RA,comment,"Simply because my pain has diminished almost completely, which I consider a miracle at this point. About a year ago was when I first got diagnosed and the only reason it happened was because I suddenly was an excruciating pain from head to toe, could barely walk and could barely use my hands. My roommate drove me to urgent care and I literally hobbled in with a cane.

So I've had that pain this whole time until I started on hydroxychloroquine about a month later. I felt better for a while but still had a lot of pain.

I then had a flare and was put on Orcenia and within about 2 weeks I could tell a huge difference. My first infusion was in July so I've had three.

I feel 90% better. The pain is gone which indicates that the damage has been stopped and most of the swelling has gone down. The only thing I have now is a bit of soreness in the morning. I'm now able to walk a couple miles a day and actually now take my dog with me which I couldn't do for months because my hands are so bad and I was worried I wouldn't be able to hold on to him if something happened.

I also do a lot of nutritional supplements such as not eating gluten or sugar because sugar will give me a flare within about 20 minutes. If I sneak a gluten-free cookie with a little bit of sugar, I can feel a bit more soreness in the morning but that's about it. I also take the usual supplements such as turmeric and fish oil definitely vitamin d.",5,k3b8z5m,,1696355082

Feeling guilty,post,"I (23f) started showing symptoms of RA the summer (july 2021) I turned 21, by December I was basically paralysed because of the illness. I couldn’t move anything and I was in constant pain. 
I got diagnosed in February 2022 and immediately got on mtx. I live in France so I didn’t have to pay anything because I have free health care.
I’m still on mtx ( 20mg injections once a week) but I still get flares sometimes and some of my joints (my elbow and my hands) are still stiff and very swollen, I have gotten used to pain by now so it’s barely a concern for me anymore. I also know which movements not to do  to avoid any pain. 
I’m still somehow in pain everyday but it really is nothing compared to how I felt before mtx. It’s to the point where I can completely ignore it and go by my day normally. Plus whenever I get a flare up I just down some naproxene (only if I’m in a lot of pain) and hope for the best.
There are many things I can’t do however because of the pain and because of how weak I am, but I just accepted it as part of my illness and I found ways around it. 

My rheumatologist thinks that I should get on a bio treatment (as well as the mtx) and the rheumatologist that I had to see at the hospital thinks so too. 
I do trust their advice and I will take whatever treatement they put me on because so far they are the only reason why I’m able to have a semi-normal life, however I feel so guilty because I don’t feel like I’m sick enough to be put on biologics. 
I’m incredibly grateful to live in a country where treatment is free and easily accessible and I’m also grateful to have been taken seriously by my  GP and that I got diagnosed relatively quickly (only 6 months).

I can’t help how guilty I feel and how these meds should go to someone who deserves them more. Although I don’t pay them I know that they are incredibly expensive and this makes me feel so much more guilty. 

I don’t think I’m sick enough to be taking such expensive meds. 

Has anyone ever felt like this? How do you cope with the guilt of “not being sick enough” ?


P.s: Im currently riding a very tough flare up so pray for me 

P.p.s: they put me on cimzia (Im taking two injections on Saturday, any advice?)",8,14f3apw,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/14f3apw/feeling_guilty/,1687341170
Feeling guilty,comment,"If your doctor feels biologics are the best treatment for you, you meet their criteria for them. It’s not about comparing you to others or who deserves them — it’s about finding what works best for you. 

You getting the best meds for you does not prevent someone else from also getting them. 

I am a therapist but not your therapist so don’t want to overstep. 😊I would encourage you to find someone to talk with about this though — to help you work through why you feel you don’t deserve appropriate medical treatment for your condition. I’m sure it’s not at all comfortable to feel this way.",13,joy4f5u,,1687346220

If your doctor wants you on the biologic then your symptoms are “bad enough.” And don’t feel guilty about needing it. There’s no shortage or anything! The manufacturers make plenty for everyone that needs it!",5,joy7d1z,,1687348020

You sound like you’re in much more pain and have more swelling than me, but I’m being put on a biologic soon (in the US, so pending insurance approval 🙄). But also, it doesn’t matter what treatment other people get, what matters is what your medical professionals think will help you. “It could be worse” - sure, but it also could be better. 

You don’t seem to think you deserve anything more than a “semi-normal life” but if new meds could give you a better life with less pain, why not? 

What would you tell a friend or relative in your situation? Wouldn’t you feel they should take the meds and not feel guilty?",5,joyackh,,1687349715
Feeling guilty,comment,"I think it has been said here, but if a doctor thinks you should get that treatment, that's really worth something. Maybe some people ""have it worse"", but in their case something else might work better. Sometimes you have to think about yourself. Be selfish. It's your health. You get an opportunity other might not get. I can't imagine what having RA feels like, but I see first hand what it does and what a difference a good medicine can have. This shitty thing in your body hurts and prevents you from being you.


If it doesn't work out, I'm sorry, but if it does, you're happier.


I don't know much about bio treatments or medicine in general, so if it's about medical advice or consideration, I'm not capable of giving you that. Your GP or rheumatologist is able to do that.


You're young with a disease that's ""for old people"". Plus side of that is that you can try a lot of meds if you need to find the right one. I think a lot of research and development is being done and progress will be made in some form.


But in the end, it's your call. If you choose not to take this drug because it doesn't feel right.... you're the only one who can make that call. Just don't make yourself less than others.


It's important to talk about it, if you feel like it. Obviously you do in a way, that's why you're here! Maybe a friend or relative that can help you decide feels good, too.

I'm finally in a position where I can exercise regularly, and in most cases, I live an almost normal life. However, I struggle with dexterity in my right hand and can't write or do much of the crafting I used to love and I was realising the only reason I didn't feel pain is because I would just avoid known triggers that would make it worse. I've just started on biologics and have learnt that you can't feel guilty about it. You being on them does not prevent other people who require it being on them. If your doctor has prescribed it, then that should be justification enough. You also deserve to have a high quality of life, and it's as much about prevention as it is about dealing with existing pain.",2,joz8rhj,,1687364897
Feeling guilty,comment,"I understand where you’re coming from. I was diagnosed at 18 and was on mtx for the first year or so, but it wasn’t viable for me because it made me feel really nauseous and I have emetophobia so I started becoming really anxious every time I had to take it and eventually I stopped taking it without consulting my doctor (don’t do that) which unfortunately lead to two of my fingers being deformed. During that time when I was struggling with mtx I remember reading an article in a magazine about an 8 year old boy who was also being treated with mtx for his JIA, and his mum was talking about how he was basically being sick every weekend so that he could go through the week, and it made me feel guilty because I couldn’t cope with what a kid was going through (now as an adult I’m more like “Jesus Christ no one should have to live their life like that”). After mtx I was being treated at the hospital once a month for about 6 months, and then I wanted to go study abroad so I asked my doctor if that was even an option for me and she prescribed me Simponi which is a bio medication. When I first learned how expensive it was I was in shock, but thankfully living in Europe, I have only ever had to pay a fraction of the cost. I’ve been on it for over 10 years now, and I’ve studied abroad in the uk and in the us and now I live in the uk, and I’m now getting it completely free on the NHS. The only criteria they have here is that you have tried 2 other treatments before. 

Sorry for the long post, but my bottom line is that you shouldn’t feel guilty. You have the right to live a full and pain free life. 

When I feel guilty or I feel like I’m not worthy of the treatment and help I’m getting I try to turn things around by saying to myself “If it were someone you knew in the same situation, you wouldn’t think twice about it, you’d be happy that they’re getting the help they deserve”.",1,jozgtbh,,1687368021

Im more annoyed that the medicine exists and isnt given to everyone who needs it “because it’s expensive”. It annoys me that if i take one a week i feel like a normal person, but because the insurance company doesn’t want to pay too much i can only take it once every two weeks. Like the medicine is just sitting in my fridge existing but im not allowed to take more and only some people can get it if the insurance says its okay.

Missed two infusions and mutlipe weeks of methotrexate, which caused the RA to show itself again.

folic acid possibly makes me feel worse?,post,"I take 15mg MTX once a week, then 1mg folic acid every day except my MTX day. this might be a total fluke, but the past few days I've been out of folic acid waiting on a refill, and I feel like I have noticeably more energy than usual.

folic acid possibly makes me feel worse?,comment,"i would definitely keep taking the folic acid at least until you've talked to your dr. folic acid is a type of b vitamin (i think) and it does important things in your body. i don't understand the mechanics of it, but mtx interferes with the way your body absorbs/uses folic acid, so if you don't take enough folic acid you'll end up with a defficiency of this particular vitamin. my rheumy told me there were no side effects of taking too much folic acid, but who knows, maybe you have a specific condition or you're on a specific med that means you CAN experience side effects from an excess of folic acid? but defs don't do anything about it without medical advice because you REALLY don't wanna end up defficient in folic acid.

"Hi, anyone tried biologics? Side effects?",post,"28F,experienced symptom Aug 2021. Entire 2022 wrong diagnosis by Oncologist. Jan this year only realised maybe it's RA. Diagnosed with >1000 anti ccp, RF. Confirmed as RA. Currently on mtx(recently increased to 7 pills weekly), plaquenil once daily and sulfasalazine 4 daily. Stopped prednisolone as i took it for 5 months over. Despite the increase in med, my readings are around 50-60, which the normal range is below 40. Doc said the medication will not help further and need to consider biologics. 
1) biologic is very expensive for me. 
2) doc said even with injection, may not be able to push my RA into remission as it may not be the correct suppression immunity route
3) risk on other infections eg TB because the biologic will suppress my immunity 
I've some side effects like drastic hairfall even with oral med thus far esp after increment of 7 mtx instead of 6. My eye checkup wasn't really well and ophthalmologist need to monitor every half year😕 
Felt really hopeless. It's like knowing the side effects the meds give me,taking them, and not showing any sign of remission. I could no longer lead a normal active lifestyle. Playing games/ typing on keyboards itself hurts.
Just wondering if anyone experienced the same and somehow got a bit better/more manageable and how long did it take? 
Also, if anyone is taking biologics and if it actually helps more than oral med? Did you feel worse after taking biologics? Or any tips on taking extra precautions etc once I started biologics?

Regarding the cost, Abbvie (Humira manufacturer) has both a copay assistance and a rebate program; I believe both reduce your payment to about $5/mo.

2. any tips and tricks to prevent joint strain?

3. are you still able to work enough to make a living?

4. what are accommodations that need to be considered?

"I have RA and I would like to become a tattoo artist , is it even possible?",comment,"I can't speak on how your body would react to becoming a tattoo artist, I can only speak on how it would affect me.

I've had RA for 13 years. It's been mostly under control the entire time. Meaning, I've been in remission for years. I take really good care of my physical health, strength training,  healthy diet, minimal alcohol,  religios with my meds, vitamins, supplements,  plenty of sleep, and I try to live as stress free as possible. 

In my past life, I was a journeyman electrician in Canada,  using my hands all day every day.   After the diagnosis, I had to permanently quit the field.  I took a few years off and tried to focus on my health, and it worked.  I tried to go back multiple times, and each time I failed.  I am unable to use my hands all day every day,  and I feel that most of the people who have RA would feel the same way.  To this day, even though I am technically in remission, I am unable to use my hands for repetitive manual labour.  

I have no idea how you'll respond to being a tattoo artist,  but if it was me, it would be a hard pass. I feel that it would cause massive strain on your finger and wrist joints, which could lead to irreversible joint damage.  

From what I've learned over my journey, it's all about joint protection.  We are still able to lead a normal life, but protecting your joints from future joint damage is one of the main priorities we need to focus on.

I won’t lie to you, this will be an uphill battle, but it is possible. The amount of drawing you need to do daily for appointments plus the vibration of the machine has been incredibly difficult for me to do consistently, and I find on days after appointments I need to rest because I have pain all the way up my arm and down my back into my ribs. I also take biologics. To answer your questions: 

1. No I have not been able to have a single session since my diagnosis without a massive flare after. However maybe your disease progression is different! I also deal with hypermobility (EDS) so this definitely adds to my pain levels. 

2. I always stretch my hands and arms before a session (there’s a great account on Instagram if you use that, I believe their account is called Handcoachcorinne) they have tons of different information for great stretches to help out 

3. I currently am unable to work enough to make a living, and have qualified for disability support 

4. I would consider at the very least using a rotary machine as the traditional style of coils are super heavy on the vibrations and also significantly heavier. Ergonomic equipment (chair, armrest, bed etc) will also help depending on where you experience RA/pain.

For me, I was tired of the 7am start times, waking up at 5 am to get to a job site 45 mins away, and all the other BS that goes into working in a labour industry. 

Do you work in a union environment? Is your company able to accommodate you, eg. Putting you in an office, white hat job site position?  You can get your white card,  giving you the ability to pull permits and supervise the underling electricians while they do the labour.  

I can't lie, it's gonna be challenging for you to continue doing labour for the next 20 years.  You won't want to swing a hammer, work in a crawl space, attic, if your joints are flaring..

Edit :

After I quit labour, I managed to land a high paying job with a local union company where I'm able to plan jobs, and supervise junior electricians.  They accommodate me when I'm having rough days, so I can work from home.  It works for me..",5,k2r1zvf,,1696008831

It’s difficult but when it’s your passion it’s so worth it to not give up. I have a Cheyenne sol Nova as well as an fk iron pen and the FK is significantly lighter. Another thing I do is get the foam grips you can get through suppliers for some added comfort on your hand.

Newly diagnosed and scared of meds,post,"Hi all 

First, so thankful for this community. I’ve been reading through a lot of posts and it truly does help to know that I am not alone. 

I (F30) was diagnosed recently with RA back in June. It started in my hands and feet in the morning but over the course of a couple of months it quickly spread to most of my joints and to be painful over longer periods of time especially when working at my desk job since I sit still for most of the day. 

The way I was diagnosed was a terrible experience but I’m trying to work it out with the hospital now. The doc I saw prescribed me MTX, 6 tablets and Folic acid. But I have A LOT of anxiety about meds. I’m the kind of person who will barely take an aspirin, unless I run a very high fever or have an insanely stubborn migraine. Especially when I then read about the side effects of MTX. 

As a side note, I should also mention that I prior to being diagnosed with RA, I’ve had other health issues as well. I’m sure they are all related though I can’t get doctors to believe that. For a couple of years now I’ve struggled a lot with heartburn and indigestion, where I have it sometimes multiple times a day for several months in a row. I’ve had my stomach checked twice for ulcers etc, but they’ve found nothing. I also had some issues with bladder infections or what felt like a painful infection where I’d just constantly feel like I had to pee and feel pain in my bladder, but the urin test never showed that I had an infection. This went on for almost 8 months and the doctors basically wrote it off as it being “psychological”. 

I want to protect my joints as best as I can, and I’ve already made huge changes to my diet and exercise routines (Mediterranean diet / anti inflammatory diet and hot water basin training) which is great and my pain is less but still present. I’m at the point where I’m contemplating meds to hopefully be pain free and back to my old self, but given my history with my “unsteady” gut I’m not really much for starting on meds that might destroy it. 

Do you have any advice? Similar experiences? I have heard you can give MTX in shots, so I’m wondering if that will be better for me? Will that work when so many of my joints are affected?",7,178p1dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/178p1dh/newly_diagnosed_and_scared_of_meds/,1697403884

You are currently comparing the med side effects to a normal healthy life which isn’t your reality anymore. The side effects of these meds is nothing compared to what the disease will do to you without them. The meds for me have brought drastic improvement and at least with biologics minimal side effects. Some people tolerate MTX well (I didn’t) but your rheumatologist should quickly move you onto something else if you have any issues with it.

Newly diagnosed and scared of meds,comment,"Prior to my diagnosis, I never relied on medication for anything. So it was quite the jump to wrap my head around.

My mentality has been to remain open minded and to at least give treatment a try. 

You are highly monitored when on these medications, so if anything changes, you will catch it very quickly. 

I have to get blood work every 3 months on MTX. I have annual eye exams for HCQ. 

I've been on HCQ for 3 years and MTX for almost a year and haven't had any issues. No real side effects either. 

The way medication has improved my quality of life is worth the potential downsides to me. I feel confident that with monitoring, I will be able to catch any negative effects early on so I can take appropriate measures if/when that happens. 

RA isn't something you can fix through diet and lifestyle. Your immune system is attacking your own body by mistake -- the only way to prevent further damage is through treatment. 

My great-grandmother died from RA, because she was alive during a time when they had no treatment. We are so lucky to be in a better place with this disease now. I do not take that for granted.

If you have a history of stomach issues, I would highly recommend you do the injectable MTX instead. I have a history of peptic ulcers & gastritis and it doesn't affect my stomach at all.",8,k51jz72,,1697411151
Newly diagnosed and scared of meds,comment,"It's great you have improved your diet, that can help with lessening symptoms and flares. However, nothing will actually treat the disease other than the meds, and you really want to be treating the disease. Untreated RA leads to joint destruction all over the body, including feet, hands, spine. And any joint damage is irreversible.  We are so lucky now to have a variety of meds to treat RA.  Methotrexate is usually the first med prescribed. Many people take it and it can be very effective with minimal side effects. I took it for several years and had no problems, it just slowly stopped working for me so I had to switch. Your doctor will closely follow you and you will have bloodwork done. If Methotrexate doesn't agree with you, there are other meds to try. Be sure to talk to your doctor about your stomach issues, they can make a determination if the injectable would be better for you. I hope you feel better soon!",4,k51oyf6,,1697413224
Newly diagnosed and scared of meds,comment,"There are plenty of lifestyle changes you can make to support your joints and improve your situation, but they won’t stop your immune system from attacking healthy tissue. You need medications for that. Somewhere along the way meds turned into a proxy for how moral/strong/hard working a person is or isn’t, and it’s sad because medications are a very useful tool. They were developed out of necessity, and I think it’s really easy to forget how much previous generations would’ve killed for the effective treatments we have today. Give yourself permission to be appropriately treated. You have a long life ahead of you, you’ll want to protect your function at all costs so you have a better quality of life when you’re 40, 50, 60, 70.

Re the recurrent UTIs, I can sympathise I also have this issue. I found that taking a high dose of D mannose supplements daily was life changing, zero side effects.

I’ve never taken steroids but was told uncontrolled inflammation can cause damage very quickly. I was in so much pain, I can still hear my joints cracking and can imagine the damage this will cause to my body. No amount of healthy diet or natural cures can work right now. I tried turmeric, Keto diet. Nothing moved the needle on pain - I felt and looked swollen all over. I had gastric issues too - as I was taking NSAIDs for pain and I tend to have a faster metabolism, so I get acidity very easily. I try to eat small frequent meals, avoid NSAIDs, take predisone with food, hcq at night and my stomach is doing much better. Give it time and trust your doctor.

It’s really tough mentally as it makes you feel lonely. As you look healthy, but you are in constant pain. And everyday something new can hurt. And get so bad suddenly- you are fine one moment and then you can’t get take another step. Days when you struggle to even feed yourself. People around you think some of this is in your head and you’d feel better if you just tried harder to move etc. No one can understand what chronic pain feels like and how debilitating it is, and how difficult is to lose your independence when you can’t do small tasks by yourself. So you need to take care of yourself to stay mentally strong. It is hard to stay hopeful but future can look very different when your disease comes under control. You’ll be able to get married - treatments exist that can get you to lead a normal life.

The physical illness (RA/connective tissue disorder and fucking recurrent shingles) is what forced me to actually address my mental and emotional (and in some sense spiritual) health. I lived an inauthentic life well into my early 30s. I’ve only in the past couple years dived down, addressed the real childhood trauma I’ve ignored and it has made at least the mental/emotional/spiritual side of my life so much better. I am myself more and more out in the world. I am calmer. I don’t have to control everyone or every situation and sometimes I let people be angry without begging for them approval etc. My emotional dis regulation is way better and my overall feelings towards myself are so different, I have empathy for myself and then it trickles into more empathy for others! . I’ve become and am becoming ME. I’m changing my mental health in VERY visible and experiential ways. One wonders…what could have been if I’d done it before…but thankfully I’m doing it now.

I did have some hair loss in the beginning but I switched to a different shampoo and chopped off the dead hair and it seems to have lessened. I’ve had much worse reactions to hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. I think it won’t hurt to try it, and if it doesn’t work out you can go to something else. None of the side effects I’ve heard are possible are permanent and should dissipate after you quit the meds. And that’s worse case scenario. Best case - you get your life back.

The MTX pills contain lactose, so this is thought to contribute to the nightmarish gastrointestinal side effects that others have experienced. I have taken Lactaid with each dose so far and have had mild nausea here and there along with some gas, but that's it. I also have a pretty sensitive stomach. I can't take Tylenol without having eaten first unless I want to throw up. I lost weight when I was pregnant because I couldn't get a handle on my nausea.

The side effects have gotten more intense for me over the past 2 years. It could be partially because it's an injection and I loathe it. But the smell of alcohol wipes makes me nauseous. It screws with my PVCs for 2 days after, and makes me feel pretty ill.

I do know plaquenil has some side effects with your eyes, I personally didn’t live it so wasn’t on it long. The drug that changed my life was Rituximab, a biologic drug that you do through infusion. It feels like I don’t have arthritis most of the time and I almost never flare on it. The downside to these drugs is the price, I had to get sick enough to get coverage for them.

Switching from MTX Injections to MTX Pills,post,"I've been on MTX injections since August 2022 and the MTX (with Plaquenil) has pushed me into remission and I've had few side affects from the MTX (occasional diarrhea, some tiredness), but I've developed near constant brain fog and psychological reaction to seeing or thinking about my MTX injections. If I see the boxes or think about it, I feel like vomiting and I get nauseated.

I was at my rheumatologist today and she mentioned upping my folic acid amounts to try and balance the brain fog but also suggested reducing my MTX dose (I'm on 25 mg/week) to 20 mg AND switch to pills because of the psychological reaction. I've never taken MTX pills before as I went straight to the injections.

Has anyone done the injection to pill switch? Anyone had a psychological reaction to the MTX injections? My doctor said some of her other patients have had the same experience.

Thanks!

Screw mtx,post,"I was on it at various dosages for about a year and a half. It made me unbelievably sick, probably because we had to keep upping the dose since it wasn't working well enough. When we upped it to 20mg, I switched to injections which were better side effect wise but still too much. By that point I developed an unhealthy amount of anticipatory nausea that nothing could manage and I just couldn't do it anymore. 

But that's not really why I have beef with mtx today. I've been off it for more than a year now and I'm still suffering the associative side effects. The mere sight of that particular shade of yellow turns my stomach and gives me a headache. Since I did the injections for a while and did them just before bed, washing my hands thoroughly under electric light makes me nauseous. 

Recently, due to some medication issues, I started taking a birth control shot. And since my toxic trait is doing everything myself, I learned how to self administer them. I have really bad tender spots from fibro in the hip/butt area so that's a no go for me so I take the shot in the thigh... The same place I did the mtx shots. Now here's my beef. Despite doing it in daylight hours in a whole different room, the simple procedure of prepping the syringe and disinfecting my skin makes me (you guessed it) nauseated. And I know it's mtxs fault because it induces a very specific kind of nausea. 

TLDR it's been more than a year since I stopped taking it, but mtx still finds ways to screw with me.",6,17eh7py,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/17eh7py/screw_mtx/,1698057091

It gave me a certain expectation and half the reason I kept trying it for so long was because everyone else seemingly had this good experience. I think it's important for people to share their experiences of both sides and not just focus on the good experiences just in case it scares someone off. I for one appreciate reading up on people's good and bad experiences just so I can make an informed decision and get an idea for what I'm about to get myself into.

food allergies while on mtx? is there anything that helps?,post,"i’m writing this post for a friend who doesn’t like social media.

in january, my friend had to start taking mtx after she had to stop taking quensyl due to side effects. before taking quensyl, she had already been on mtx for two years but had to discontinue bc she kept getting sick and developing allergies to entire food groups while on it. now she’s had to go back on mtx and is starting to get reactions to different kinds of food again. we were wondering if this is common. have any of you developed intolerances or allergic reactions while on mtx? is there anything that has helped you with this?

my friend’s rheumatologist told her that quensyl and mtx are the only meds available to her so the fact that both cause serious side effects is pretty depressing. is there anything else that you’d recommend or that has helped you with your ra or to tolerate your meds better?

Also, I've been on mtx for a long time and have been allergic to a lot of foods except for chicken that is home-raised. It makes me wonder what exactly is causing the mtx to react against. Vaccines and depression in the animals eaten are triggers that I highly suspect cause the ra inflammation to worsen. I'm not against vaccines, but the poor conditions that require the animals to be pumped with antibiotics are causing negative feedback loop that is detected by certain people, I bet - though I have no lab to test that aside from my own body.

Nauseas with meds - Help?,post,"I'm 48 yrs old, female, dx with RA in March 2023.

I was on MTX, folic acid and sulfasalazine but my rheumy switched me from sulfasalazine to lefluminide because the sulfa was making me really nauseated.  I've been taking lefluminide for about two weeks now and I'm finding myself nauseaus again.

BUT, my son and husband just got over covid (I didn't get it this time - thanks vaccines) AND I'm going through perimenopause so I'm never sure if my symptoms are RA, peri or something else.

Nauseas with meds - Help?,comment,"are you still taking methotrexate? sulfasalazine didn't personally make me nauseous (it also didn't work for my arthritis which is why i stopped it). methotrexate on the other hand caused the worst nausea i've ever experienced for 1-2 days following and i eventually stopped bc of side effects (nausea + others). zofran was the only reason i tolerated mtx for as long as i did, it really helps nausea - there are also other options doctors can prescribe for nausea.

i currently take leflunomide (along with humira + naproxen) and i have been taking it for over 2 years now. i have a much reduced appetite and nausea with leflunomide, but for the longest time i didn't realize they were side effects because they happened all day, every day, not worse immediately after leflunomide or anything (i take it every morning). for me, the side effects are not nearly as bad as other meds and leflunomide has really helped my arthritis.

i also have migraines and dysautonomia which give me nausea so maybe it isn't completely from the leflunomide, but i think leflunomide is definitely contributing to it. 

**TLDR**; leflunomide side effects kinda crept up on me and didn't seem as immediate in relation to taking the pill as opposed to methotrexate injections/pills. so your nausea definitely could be caused by that. however, there are options to help this if the medication helps - such as a zofran or other prescription for nausea, and holistic treatments for the nausea (peppermints and sea bands is what i use to combat the nausea)",5,k55b0e7,,1697479823

just tired,post,"total vent post lol. almost too tired to type this out. I just feel like it keeps getting worse. I'm at the point now where I can't even make it past 6pm without being so tired I'm dizzy. I almost had to pull over the other day while driving home. so much of my free time is spent sleeping. I just want to live a normal life. 

I'm not on meds right now because I'm worried about my current meds. I mentioned GI side effects with MTX. I know some of y'all have mentioned being switched to injections if you had GI side effects but that wasn't even offered to me. I didn't ask because I'm just so fucking tired of having to advocate for myself. I was prescribed sulfasalazine but I haven't taken it because I've read you can have GI side effects with that too. I'm currently seeing an allergist to see if there's a way I can take Enbrel again (it was really helping me but I started getting these huge injection-site welts). 

my last rheum appt he said that if I didn't do well on the sulfasalazine that insurance would probably approve the Enbrel. but insurance approval was never the problem? this is my 5th rheumatologist. my first appt with him he knew my history before I even walked in the door. apparently the third one I saw was in an affiliated hospital with the same EMR so he saw her note. even though she pretty much told me I was crazy he said he def thought I had seronegative RA and started talking about all the treatment options I hadn't tried and just really seemed to know his shit. my second appt with him it's like he didn't know anything about my history. he offered me leflunomide (that I'd already taken years ago and felt worse). and then mentioned insurance and Enbrel, seeming to forget about the injection-site reactions I had. and didn't seem concerned about the GI side effects of MTX at all; he said I could keep taking it if I wanted.

I'm just really tired.

I went off Enbrel after a year because it stopped working for me and switched to Humira, a very similar drug to Enbrel - and no welts or pain with injection!

How many injections did you do after you started getting the welts with Enbrel?  I had that happen too, and they eventually improved greatly. I did the same as another responder suggest and took Benedryl. I still sometimes have small reactions but it is not nearly as bad as it was.

Hello everyone just wanted to get some advice on what to do next,comment,"Well, source: me (who had rapid-onset, debilitating, stage 4 RA since 2006) says that based on this there is no reason to suspect you have RA.

What does your bloodwork show? What’s your CRP? What’s your ESR? Specific ANA? ANA titer? What led you to suspect RA? Was there an earlier post that I could reference?",3,j2jlg00,,1672605710

Hello everyone just wanted to get some advice on what to do next,comment,"I’d look for a new rheumatologist because elevated ESR alone can’t diagnose you. If literally every other test is negative, your MRI shows no damage other than a sprain  I wouldn’t think a doctor could reasonably diagnose you with any autoimmune disease or put you on meds. Why are they suggesting MTX? Your ANA is normal, you have no ANA specific markers, your CRP is normal, your physical exam and imaging are normal… none of that warrants MTX.  All ESR tracks is inflammation but it could be a thyroiditis, it could be cancer, it could be because you have an injury and lots of inflammation. A high ESR is not abnormal after surgery, for instance. There’s no chronic condition causing it. How high was your ESR if I may ask?

Hello everyone just wanted to get some advice on what to do next,comment,"Hey there, not sure if you knew this but the arthritis foundation has changed their definition of seropositivity as being those who have positive Anti CCP as opposed to RF as positive RF can be a varied number of conditions other than RA. 

Based on your description, and these new guidelines you are actually seropositive which does make a difference in how Rheumatologists approach treatment and management of the disease. 

Here's the source: 
In seropositive RA, blood tests show unusually high levels of antibodies called anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCPs). https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/more-about/what-type-of-ra-do-you-have",3,j2luwp5,,1672644658
Hello everyone just wanted to get some advice on what to do next,comment,"I tested negative for all my test (besides ANA which was 1:640 positive), and my rheumatologist gave me a preliminary diagnosis of sero-negative RA since about half of my joints visible swelling and stiffness, my symptoms are consistent with RA, and I have a high family history of autoimmune arthritis (literally all the women in my family has either rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis). But it’s preliminary because I need to get the imaging done (which she wanted me to wait until 2 weeks before my next appointment, which is 2 weeks from today). But, I also have been responding positively to the hydroxychloroquine that my rheum put me on

So I think OPs rheumatologist may have had reasoning to suspect RA from a physical examination. But maybe the imaging now cancels it out.

"Starting Arava (Leflunomide). Taking it by itself, is that normal?",comment,"There's no one silver bullet for the condition so it may mean trying a few things out to see what works for you. In my experience they'll say 12 weeks for something new (and then maybe give it longer if there's no immediate result. )  
I had about 8 months of guessing until I progressed to a biologic.   
Prednisone to try to control the symptoms while we tried out methotrexate, then added hydroxychloroquine and then leflunomide.  
Once there was demonstrated benefit from the adalimumab we were able to drop the prednisone, then the leflunomide, and most recently, reduce the methotrexate dosage with a view to discontinuing that too.   
The prednisone came with the most danger so I was under constant pressure from my rheumy to stop taking that, and then the leflunomide had the most likelihood of side effects so we were both happy to see the back of it. (I keep some prednisone on hand if I've had, or am planning on having, a really big day. )  
I'd say they want you to stay away from methotrexate (which is the most common treatment) because of your age because it ""is not recommended in pregnancy or while trying for a baby. This medicine can stay in a woman's body for 6 months after they stop taking it. For men, there is a risk that methotrexate can damage sperm. This can affect the way a baby develops during pregnancy."" (NHS). (Constantly hear of doctors assuming potential pregnancy despite patient protestations 'just to be safe'.)  
Definitely ask what their thinking is for peace of mind.   
For the record, I woke up to go for a wizz the first night after taking the biologic and found I could walk pain-free for the first time in 9 months. Not a dream: just hit the right drug finally.   
I'd also recommend hitting up old posts (maybe searching for leflunomide as long as you don't get worked up about tiny chances of side effects) to see other newbies war stories as well as all the healthy lifestyle stuff (and placebos) that can help you cope.   
For my hands (and wrists) I did heat and cold in the mornings (hot shower, ice in the sink full of water, strap-on ice packs, pressure gloves. )

Question About Reusing MTX Vials (Multi Doses From One Bottle),post,"Hi, so I feel really silly asking this. I started Methotrexate injections back in January.

So I noticed the other day that it says to discard unused portion. Oops. Never even thought about it...MTX is hard to get your hands on right now, and I feel very fortunate to have my prescription filled. It never crossed my mind to throw multiple doses in the trash. It's stored at room temperature and the little vials have a self-sealing rubber cap. I meant to ask my doctor when I saw him today, but completely forgot.

Humira and AbbVie Experience,post,"Hello everyone. This is my first time posting. I (27f) was diagnosed with seronegative RA in May and was prescribed HCQ at the same time. After having four flares within five weeks, my rheum had me come in for an emergency appointment today. She decided to skip MTX and go straight to Humira. The medical assistant gave me my first dose today and my next injection is in two weeks. How has Humira been working for you? Do you have any tips?

Finally, I have signed up with AbbVie already to get the copay card and travel case. I would like to get the sharps container too but I can’t find where to order it. What has been your experience working with the company or specialty pharmacy?

Thank you!",2,16uqe2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16uqe2v/humira_and_abbvie_experience/,1695932335
Humira and AbbVie Experience,comment,"The company Abbvie has been a lifesaver and the nurse they assign you for the first few months can be very helpful. If they haven't already called you yet don't worry and call the company's helpline if you have any questions at all. 
I have very little to say for my specialty pharmacy experience with CVS Specialty Pharmacy and only bad things at that. They have done everything from taking over 8 weeks with me crying for hours on the phone to just get my meds started, not getting my savings card right, blaming my medical insurance for thing THEY did wrong, and the most recent event was they were trying to charge me $1000/mo for my humira because my savings card ran out! Fyi I did get it fixed (=more hours screaming and crying on the phone) and I pay $0 out of pocket",4,k2nk17r,,1695946195
Humira and AbbVie Experience,comment,"Humira is working for me fairly well so far -- it can take a few months to fully kick in, but my inflammation is improving on it and I'm noticing more aches toward the end of the 2 weeks when I'm nearing the next dose. 

The Abbvie nurse ambassadors are nice -- mine Facetimed me to walk me through giving myself the injection the first time, which was helpful since I was nervous. They will ask you if you've had any side effects after injections and can tell you about the more common ones. I also use the Complete app to log my injections. 

I have a sharps container, but I think mine was delivered through CVS Specialty? (I'd log in to double check for you, but their site seems to be down lol.) I'm pretty sure I saw a note that they're having delays on ordering more sharps containers. If you have any thick plastic bottles, like for orange juice or something, you can use one of those for a while. In my state, I can dispose of sharps that way after sealing the lid with duct tape or something. 

I do my injections in my stomach, and they are usually pretty painless. Sometimes a bit of a sting. Make sure to give yourself time after using the alcohol wipe, you want to let that air dry. I also leave my pen out of the fridge for at least 30 minutes just to make sure it's not still cold at all. 

One useful thing I found on the AbbVie FAQ was that Humira can be kept at room temp for up to 14 days (protected from light), which is useful if your injection day falls on a date you'll be away for a few days. You just can't put it back in the fridge after it comes to room temp, and you have to use that pen within the 14 days.",1,k2pv6ym,,1695992726
Humira and AbbVie Experience,comment,"Loved Humira, mild flu-ishness for a day or two after injections for the first couple months, but electrolytes helped. Injection- press firmly. Too light, you’ll leak some/all of the dose, too hard and you might have the pen fling back. Just firmly. When I started Humira a year ago, the only sharps container they gave was with the whole welcome kit, which I had to order separately. But once you’re all set up on CVS, you should be able to add it to your monthly order. CVS is a total pain in the ass and you’ll probably need to call them 57 times before you’re all good and set up, but after that initial set-up, you just go online and a couple clicks, and your order is in. The set-up phone call took almost two hours for me, so heads up you might want to do it when you have plenty of time. I’m assuming you’re in the US; insurance companies have 30 days to approve/deny the PA, (though that could just be my insurance, but I think it’s all) and then CVS has X number of days that they spend doing god knows whatever they’re doing, so unless you’re getting an expedited process, it’ll take a little while to get your first order. After that, you can order following your prescription schedule, and they ship it next-day. If you’re eco-conscious, you’ll need to buy a bigger house to store all the styrofoam shipping containers in, or maybe start your own recycling plant. Pretty sure there’s a Shipping Containers Hoarders Anonymous sub on here somewhere.

Keratitis. Ugh,post,"Not really a rant anymore. I typed one up yesterday and deleted it in less than 5 min. I was feeling whiney. 😆. Hey. It happens. 

So I have PUK. Peripheral ulcerative keratitis. Diagnosed. Linked to my diagnosed RA. I’ve had it awhile.  I get special drops for it. They work. Cool. Only now the incidences are increasing in frequency. For a systemic approach, I take Enbrel as a monotherapy. MTX made me decently sick so we pulled it. 

My question is whether any others have had this happen and been able to kinda wrangle it. 

Im not expecting a bunch of people to have it. A high percentage of people with it have RA or a similar condition, but the reverse is not the case. I just thought I’d ask here on the off-chance someone also has this diagnosis.

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,post,"hi there! all kind responses will be much appreciated :) 

context: i (22F) have been diagnosed with RA for only about 10 months now and am currently in the process of choosing between two different advanced therapy biologic options. i have been on triple therapy of mtx, hydroxychloroquine (plaquenil), and sulfasalazine for 8 months now without seeing the greatest results (definitely less symptoms but still not symptom free, consistently and constantly struggling with pain and fatigue). i am grateful to be in a position to be able to be the one making the decision but also its a fairly big decision and it feels somewhat daunting! also i have just recently found this sub and it has been so reassuring to read other posts and to see the support that is so clearly present here; i am sure we are all too aware of how lonely this RA journey can seem so this is just really great to see/be a part of.

as i am in the process of making this decision i am trying to gain knowledge about the science side of the medications (the mechanisms of action in the body/how they work to help RA) but i am also super curious about the 'human' side of the medications (what it is like actually being on them) and hearing this from 'real' people and not just in medical/statistical jargon from clinical studies lol!

the options given to me by my rheumatologist are Cimzia (injectable TNF inhibitor) and Rinvoq (pill JAK inhibitor). the decision is ultimately mine to make at this point but he does say that he would choose the Rinvoq; yet for some reason, i just can't easily get past the fact that JAK inhibitors are relatively new and there isn't the same level/amount of long term data to study the long term effects of JAKs compared to the TNFs.

my question(s): any advice with making this decision? anyone with experience being on these medications? (good experiences and bad experiences are welcome!) how concerned do i need to be about the risks/scary side effects of medications like these? any words of encouragement to help see past the scary parts? any words of encouragement in general lol!

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,comment,"I (44F) was on methotrexate for about 3 months since my seropositive RA diagnosis in November 2022. I didn’t see significant improvement so my doctor mentioned trying Enbrel, which is a TNF inhibitor. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction. It made me break out in hives all over my back, stomach and arms. I stopped taking it and saw my doctor who then recommended Rinvoq. He said most people did extremely well on it. 

I started the medicine and felt great for the first two weeks. But then I started to feel flu-like symptoms. Within a day I had the highest fever I’ve ever had in my life. I tried to bring it down on my own but nothing worked. Decided to go to the ER and they admitted me to the hospital. As they were taking me to the room I had seizure (something that has never happened to me). I was in the hospital for 7 days total and the first 4 days they had no idea what was wrong with me. I just kept getting sicker and sicker. They had me on IVs, several broad spectrum antibiotics hoping one would work and magnesium because my blood pressure was dangerously low. Finally they tested me for strep pneumonia and did a CT scan and that came back positive. They gave me a different antibiotic and steroid shots and I finally started to feel better. I was sent home with another round of antibiotics and told I can restart the Rinvoq. 

I knew I couldn’t take it while on antibiotics or with an active infection so I waited about three weeks to take it again. I took it right after dinner and in less than 30 minutes, my face turned bright red, I developed a fever and I was shivering uncontrollably. Then the vomiting started. I had to be rushed to the ER again. I almost passed out in triage and they rushed me to a room. Basically I was in septic shock. I spent another three days in the hospital, this time in the ICU. After explaining the series of events to a multitude of doctors, the consensus was that I had a severe reaction to Rinvoq during both hospitalizations.

It has taken me months to recover. I’m just now starting to feel like myself again and getting my energy and strength back. My doctor just started me on Plaquenil, which he says is the mildest of all the medications. It’s too soon to tell if it will work. In the meantime, I have prednisone to help me deal with the joint pain. But let me tell you, building up the courage to try another medicine was tough. The mental struggle from the medical anxiety was almost as bad as the physical pain I went through. 

I know this is a negative story, and I don’t mean to scare you. But I wish I had seen stories like this when I was starting out with these new meds, especially because I had the same concern of it being a much more recent drug and possibly not studied as much. But when I asked about possible side effects, I was kind of dismissed like every drug has side effects. And while I understand that, this one almost killed me. 

Even now when I googled Rinvoq to see if others had experienced what I experienced, I couldn’t find any one who had gone through something similar. Maybe that means my experience is extremely rare and it won’t happen to you. I truly hope that’s the case. But at least you know what’s possible and to look out for any strange symptoms. I wish you the best on this journey.",6,jt39fvr,,1690092303

I’ve been on it for 2 months now (in combination with the methotrexate that I’ve been on for 2 years) and I haven’t had any major side effects but it also doesn’t seem to be doing much. I felt great for about 2 weeks then got a UTI and even though I didn’t stop taking the Rinvoq, it’s like I just reverted back to how I was before I started it.  I’ve had a consistent mild sore throat since I’ve started taking it and it makes me tired. I take it before bed and the tiredness seems to wear off by morning. I’m a bit concerned with how quickly I got a UTI when I haven’t had one in about 20 years until now so definitely going to be watching for that…

Overall it’s not bad, but also doesn’t seem to be helping much yet. I know they say it can take 3 months to really see if it’s working, like all RA meds, so I’m staying hopeful but I have a feeling I’ll be switching to TNF inhibitors next month.",1,jt5ip2h,,1690137834

can i ask how long you were on the other medications before they started to work less well for you?

fingers crossed that if i also choose it, it will also take the edge off my fatigue as well. for me it's easier to 'suck it up' and deal with the joint pain than it is to deal with the fatigue (not that having to deal with the pain is easy by any means lol!) 

i'm not super certain of obvious benefits of the injection compared to the pill...in my opinion it seems so equal in terms of pros and cons of each; like if the injection has a con for one reason then the pill has the pro of that reason (and if the pill has a con for a reason then the injection has the pro for that reason). i think this is part of the reason that it is such a difficult decision because one option or the other doesn't stick out to me as a clear 'winner'!",1,jt682ap,,1690148411

Methotrexate questions,post,"Hi there!
So after 5 years being misdiagnosed several times I was diagnosed with RA earlier this week. I feel so many things and I think it will take some time to really come to terms with this. I am glad though that now that the correct problem is identified I can start working towards some relief.
I was started on Methotrexate (6 pills once a week) and folic acid on the days I don’t take the MTX. I started the MTX on Wednesday.
For those who have experienced side effects with this, did you experience them as soon as you began taking this, or did they come on over time? I only experienced slight dizziness the night I took it as well as slight stomach upset and a minor headache yesterday and today. I am just wondering if I will experience more side effects in time or if I am just fortunate to be tolerating it well.
Also, is ibuprofen ok to take while on Methotrexate? My doctor did not mention not to, but from my reading I just wanted to see if this may be an issue. If not, what else OTC can be taken for the pain? I know the medication takes time to bring about improvement but right now I am hurting bad 😞

Methotrexate questions,comment,"I've been on methotrexate for 3 years now. Your doctor should be having you complete labs every month or so to make sure it's not negatively impacting your liver. If it does, they will likely reduce the amount you take weekly.

I don't recall any major side effects at the beginning and still don't to this day. My rheumatologist prescribed Naproxen as well b/c it's less likely to cause gut issues and it lasts longer in your system.

Methotrexate questions,comment,"Stick with it: unfortunately you're probably in for a long journey until the right meds are sorted out. 

Everyone's an individual and the reality of modern medicine is that testing is a numbers game. You never know how efficacious they will be for an individual, nor what side effects might appear. Nor what will work for you and your condition. 

For methotrexate there's also the injection option to take the pressure off your gut but you've got to put time in to see what the right dose is, or even if it's right for you. 

If you're also taking NSAIDs then they will put extra pressure on the system so watch your dose, take food with them, and check with your rheumy. As already said they may look at steroids in the short term to reduce inflammation and pain. 

All the best.",2,k4voul8,,1697310690

I admit I was terrified of the potential stomach side effects and hair loss but I never had any of that.

Methotrexate and Alcohol,post,"Hey yall, I tried looking it up but didn't get much info. Excuse my imposter posting, I actually have Lupus, not RA, but have been on methotrexate for a while now and I havent found much info on MTX from other lupus patients. However I noticed its FAR more common in treating RA. 

I wanted to ask about the occasional alcohol. Im only 23, and I get one occasion to drink once a year. Im going camping here soon, the first time since my diagnosis had bedridden me, and I always drink with my friends and the thought of abstaining kinda makes me depressed. I have been starting to improve and feel better since starting treatment, and I need things to feel and go back to normal. It sounds crazy... but that drunk camping trip night is very important to feeling like myself again. 

I asked my rheumatologist about alcohol, but he hasnt responded, and my next appointment is after the trip. I also cannot use cannabis under any circumstances as a substitute, as Im a DOT driver and Im due for a random drug test any day. 

Is there any possible way I can safely drink alcohol? Just for that weekend? Any tips or advice is helpful. 


Just in case, the Lupus affects more my skin, joints, and brain, and thankfully hasnt touched my kidneys or liver. Im completely healthy on that front, even with 25mg of MTX.",6,13adwtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/13adwtw/methotrexate_and_alcohol/,1683437113

Now that I'm back on azathioprine and I do drink more frequently and I'm even going to a BBQ today and I will be drinking. 

As everyone else has said, it's very personal how the drugs impact you and you have to decide, with input from rheumatology (whether that's the specialist nursing squad or your doc).

"Anyone Else Developed The ""Ick"" For Their Medicine?",comment,"It's totally not in your head. I was just complaining about this exact thing and I've been off mtx for more than a year. It's called anticipatory nausea and it's most commonly seen in cancer patients while they do chemo. It's less common in low dise mtx but still very much a real thing. And it isn't just the nausea either. I also had that building dread the few hours leading up to a dose. Your brain learns to associate certain experiences with the side effects you get from mtx. So then when you gi to take mtx, that association is accessed in your brain and bam, side effects. For me it's that particular shade of yellow and scrubbing my hands clean under electric lighting. Even just thinking about mtx is enough to make me feel quesy some days.

Edit: as for advice, my doctor told me to try taking something for nausea an hour or so before the mtx dose (although this didn't really help much for me since the nausea started way earlier in the day). I've found that smelling peppermint oil helps a lot and someone else has pointed out that taking a whiff of alcohol disinfectant would do the same thing.",5,k65cr46,,1698089996

My rheumatologist doesn't really understand why taking meds is so hard for me (me neither), but maybe it's worth trying to talk to your doctor. There are anti-nausea pills I think! When I also dreaded the injections, I rewarded myself with candy afterwards. Not propably the healthiest way, but children get stickers after doctor's appointments, so I, as an adult, decided to use same logic to motivate myself to take my medication :D And after quitting multiple times and always, always getting the inflammation and pain back, reminding myself of this finally motivates me enough to take my meds.",1,k65zwqy,,1698098253

Or something that always helps your tummy?

I’m sorry I don’t have more advice but I also recommend applying for disability services through your school to get accommodations for RA. My rheumatologist suggested I do this since the pain, inflammation and stiffness in my hands means I type much slower than I use to and need frequent breaks. I applied and requested accommodations for extra time on assignments due to my mobility issues and the fact my pain can make me miss class or need the extra time for assignments, my inflammation gets so bad in my hands I can’t drive safely at times.

Decreased MTX dose & side effects,post,"I've been on the same weekly oral methotrexate dose for several years. No flare ups ever. In August, five months ago, my rheumatologist said, your disease is stable, let's try lowering the dose and see if you can get by with less medication. I am wondering if decreasing the dose has caused hives and/or chest pain 

In October I began having intermittent chest pain. It wasn't too painful, and it was on the right side, so I just went on with life. In November I had a really painful and long lasting episode, so I went to the emergency room. They did EKG, CT scan, blood work. It wasn't a heart attack. They didn't know what it was. I followed up with my primary care doctor who said that it was probably a muscle strain and seemed quite uninterested in exploring the actual cause. I still have intermittent chest pains. 

In December my CRP was a very high 39 mg/L. 

Mid January, about 3 weeks ago, I began breaking out into hives all over my body. It's not from a new soap or detergent. The joints in my fingers feel a little spongy to me, but they aren't painful or swollen. 

I have an appointment with the rheumatologist in a few weeks, but I wondered if anyone else had this with a decreased dose of methotrexate. Maybe my immune system is ramped up because the methotrexate isn't dampening it with the lower dose?",4,10wmte2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/10wmte2/decreased_mtx_dose_side_effects/,1675829216

Ears ringing from Hydroxychloroquine?,post,"Hey! 
Did anyone experience ear ringing and/or muffled hearing while taking hydroxychloroquine? 
I just started taking it like 2-3 weeks ago and since a few days I‘m having these ear problems, especially in the left ear.
I already went to see a GP who transferred me to an ENT who then checked my ears.
He told me my ears are fine.
After that I checked the package information leaflet from the HCQ where I found the information that problems like this might occure while taking the medication.
I already called my rheumatologists office to ask the doctor if this is dangerous and if I should continue to take the meds. The nurse told me the doctor will call me back but I haven‘t heard from her yet.
Has anyone experienced similar symptoms and can tell me if this might be dangerous? 
I was diagnosed a few months ago with RA and already had a bad experience with MTX due to horrible side effects which required a lot of doctors visits. I‘m very anxious atm.

Ears ringing from Hydroxychloroquine?,comment,"I am not sure about muffled hearing that may or may not be more serious (I have no idea) than tinnitus (ringing). I know for tinnitus that is generally a temporary thing that will disappear or lessen ovrer time and will go away if you discontinue the medicine (so not permanent). Obviously if it does not disappear like let's say after 4-6 weeks, then you will need to decide if it is worth the side effect to continue the drug or if you are taking 400mg try to reduce the dose to see if it changes, etc.

Maybe look up plaquenil and altered hearing, reduced hearing, etc. Of course based on the ENT report you likely do not have reduced hearing. It is more your perception of hearing that has changed. In my case my hearing feels a bit reduced from HCQ but that is likely because my jaw hurts right now. If you have a flare or TMJ or anything else that affects your jaw, then that can also affect your hearing. Something to keep in mind. It might even be the perception of the ring which is a sound close to your ear and therefore sounds that are ""far away"" are deprioritized by your brain (aka muted or out of focus sounding). Basically the ring is drowning out other sounds.",2,jueul1t,,1690932476

My story- any advice?,post,"
Hi everyone! I’m not sure what I’m really asking for… maybe just support. I’m having one of those nights where I can’t sleep due to pain so I’m just awake and anxious. I wanted to see if maybe anyone has any advice about things I’m going through. 

I (29F) was diagnosed with seronegative RA late 2022. I had started having a lot of pain in my hands in August 2022 but I’d already had a lot of chronic pain for years. The rheumatologist had me take prednisone for a few months, which I definitely don’t want to be on long term. It did help somewhat but the higher doses that helped the pain also gave me panic attacks. So far I’ve tried Sulfasalazine (gave me headaches) and methotrexate tablets & injectable (gave me stomach problems). Now I’m on leflunomide (no side effects yet but my pain is also worse than ever). I’m still taking the folic acid for 8 weeks after stopping the MTX. I’m also on diclofenac and cymbalta. 

I’ve been so stressed about work. I work part time and am getting a masters degree. A lot of things in my life seem to have taken a backseat because it takes all the energy I have just to focus on school and work. I was told by HR that I don’t qualify for any FMLA because I’m part time. They recommended I try to get disability. So I got that approved and I know my doctor asked them to let me call out up to 4 days a month, but HR only approved 1 day a month. There are some months where this is fine, but usually I’m calling out 3-4 days. Luckily my boss is very understanding (we work in healthcare) and he said he doesn’t really care how much I call in as long as I keep communicating with him. He said the most HR can do is tell him “hey she’s called out too much” but it’s up to him if I get fired and he won’t do that. I do trust him but as you can imagine I’m still relatively uneasy knowing that my disability only covers 1 day and my job basically is relying on his word. I was told there was a medical disability I could take for up to 12 weeks but it’s not job protected. It’s also unpaid which would be really hard for me because I’m already living paycheck to paycheck. Within the next year my department will also be moved so we’ll have new management. I’m very worried and assuming that my new boss won’t be as accommodating as my current one. On top of that, I have to wait until May 2024 to get a surgery that I really need. My insurance wouldn’t cover it until I’ve been at my current workplace for 3 years. So my health also hinges on me being able to keep my job until then.

Otherwise, I just feel like I’ve been so depressed and in pain 24/7 for about a year now. None of the medication has worked well and I feel so alone. My boyfriend is really supportive but I know there’s no way he can really understand. Especially on the days I feel like I can’t work, I get so irritated with him when he asks me if I can tough it out. I feel like I’ve been doing that for a year and I’m exhausted. I can’t imagine going on like this much longer. My hands are always in so much pain. Trying to simply write something down feels like when you’re lifting weights and you’re just like “come on just push one more time.” All my muscles ache. I’m constantly hot, like dripping sweat all the time and having 3 fans on me at home when it’s 65*F. My legs are always aching and it often wakes me up at night. Every time I tell my rheumatologist how miserable I am I feel like I’m brushed off. I’m always told to just “wait a little longer” but nothing changes and I’m not sure what I’m waiting for. I’m trying to find a new rheumatologist but a lot of them where I live aren’t accepting new patients. I think I’m just having a hard time adjusting to my new level of physicality. I used to be someone so motivated and would get so much done in a day. Now I study for a few minutes and look around at how messy I’ve let my home get because I can’t stand up long enough to clean it. It’s been making me feel extremely bad about myself and it sort of just feels like I’m in this little bubble of pain that separates me from everyone else. 
Anyway, that’s about it. I’m so sorry this was so long. I just wanted to tell my story. Thanks for reading.",9,16e4x3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16e4x3r/my_story_any_advice/,1694263681
My story- any advice?,comment,"My opinion, so take it as an opinion. You have too much going on to focus on your wellness. I think you need to take a pause on grad school. Can you finish the semester and take a break or is it early enough for you to take a break now? You can work with the department/advisor and the disability resource center. 

Next, do some research into finding a new drug. Go to your rheumatologist and tell them you have a plan you would like to try. The biologics are a great option. The drug companies have funds to help you afford it. Get on prednisone right now so you can have enough pain relief to get on the new drug. You can ween yourself off in the future. Ask for an anti inflammatory prescription like naproxen. You have to advocate for yourself. Don’t take the status quo from your doctor. Tylenol pm can help with sleep. 

Tell your boyfriend what you need from him. He doesn’t know. My husband gives me my injections of Cimzia because I have a hard time with needles. I ask for help opening containers or lifting things. I also need hugs and I ask for them. 

Rest and sleep when you need it. 
Find an outlet for depression and anxiety. For example, I started a night time routine. It’s weird but helps. I floss, wash my face, put on moisturizer, and brush my teeth. I tidy up the kitchen. Then I get in bed and journal. I have a journal with prompts to answer. I put lotion on my hands and feet. I feel like a old fashion woman from the 1960s. The routine has provided calm for me. I make sure to take some deep breaths. Maybe you can find something that works for you. 

You are in a tough spot right now. Be kind to yourself. Advocate for yourself. Take control as much as you can. It will get better. I have faith in you!

Message me if you want. I’ve been in your spot and know how tough it is.",11,jzuvoax,,1694288851
My story- any advice?,comment,"Sounds like you're really having a hell of a time. I'm so sorry. Could you possibly try a biologic? If copays are a problem, most of the biologic companies have $ assistance for people with private insurance.

With all you're doing with school and work both, that would probably be tough for someone without arthritis. For you, though, with the extra load you have to carry, it's even tougher. I think it's somewhat miraculous that you're able to do all you are with the pain you have. I remember years ago when I was in grad school, and a prof told me just that - what I was doing was miraculous. Made me feel kind of proud. The work and stress really took a toll on me though. Is there any way you might be able to carry a lighter load with your grad program?

You are not alone with this. I live with pain whenever I'm conscious and especially when I move around because I've had JRA so long. Lots of people are here to help you through this.

My story- any advice?,comment,"The spoon theory is very useful to adapt to chronic illnesses: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory

First, get on a biologic. Advocate for yourself that the existing meds are not working for you. Find a new Rheumat if you have to. Pain is the main indicator of disease activity and not blood markers. I’m Seronegative and my doctor is treating me based off my symptoms entirely. All biologic companies have discount programs that would cover your deductibles. Call your insurance and get approval for biologics like Humira. They are far better at slowing disease progression. Tell the doctor you are in a critical phase of your life with completing a master and working. You cannot do that with constant pain and you need treatment. 

Second, talk to your university. They should be able to give you a semester off for medical reasons which should give you enough time to find a treatment that works. If financial aid is an issue, you can try to seek exemption on medical grounds. Point is, talk to people at your grad school. You’ll likely find people are more helpful than you’d expect. 

Third, find a job that has better HR policies. Work from home as much as you can. I know the job market is tough right now, and finding a job is a stress in itself. But you have to find a way to reduce stress on yourself. Noone like living in a dirty messy house. But ask yourself, is it the most important thing in your life right now? Prioritising is the most important thing to you right now. Again, ask for help. 

You have a very painful life changing disease. You cannot get through this without making major changes and you are going to need to ask for help. As no one can know what you are going through. I’ve had to inform my work of my condition- I absolutely hate anyone knowing my personal business. I’ve had to ask my spouse to take over the house work as doing any housework brings on a lot of pain for me. My spouse didn’t understand how bad I was till I told him in detail how I feel- my joints feel like theyve been glued together. I’m in pain every second of everyday. If I try to tough it out and keep on going as normal, I’ll crash into bed and not be able to go to even the bathroom. Tell your BF to read about RA fatigue and pain, and develop some real empathy. It’s not regular arthritis that happens in one joint. All your joints are failing you. Repeat the message till it sinks in. Stop carrying on as normal. When you do that, it makes your bf believe you are alright. I tried and I got so much worse. I do what I absolutely have to now and I’m feeling much better. You’ll also feel more in control of your life and pain when you start making decisions prioritising your health. 

Chronic pain is a whole different beast. And RA is worse because it limits your mobility severely, yet you look completely normal. Depressions is common. Antidepressants might help, but what I’ve found has helped is being open about what I’m going through and seeking support and help. If your bf refuses to give it, I would be reevaluating the whole relationship honestly. Point him to the spoon theory. 

When you can’t do something, say I don’t have enough spoons! I’ve had to delay important things in life as I just cannot sustain much right now. I’m barely able to get through half a day of low activity. It’s okay to take steroids for shorter term: a few months is really alright. Years and years are damaging. Take NSAIDs. The inflammation will cause you more damage than any medicines can. This is a tough tough time but you will get better. You have to advocate for yourself with doctors, at work, at college and with your bf. No one will just help us because we are in pain! I hope you get better soon. You are so strong to be doing so much when you are in such pain. You can do this! Good luck!",4,jzwosdg,,1694315604
My story- any advice?,comment,"Hey, I really agree with the previous poster that for your well-being you're going to need to cut back some with all you're doing. Work and grad school together is a lot for a healthy person to handle. Experiencing constant pain while doing all that is IMO maybe asking too much of yourself. In no way does that mean you're somehow weak or less than. You just have an extra load to carry.

In my prior post, I mentioned how driving myself mercilessly in grad school while in intense pain and needing hip replacements took a real toll on me. I was determined to try to go at the same pace as everyone else and denied that I had a hell of an extra load to bear. I refused to admit to myself that I was ""different."" Well I ended up in a very severe major depressive episode, feeling panicked all the time, and trying to drink my pain away. I had to cut back or I might have ended up even worse off.

I don't know if any of this is at all helpful for you, but I'm hoping you might find something to relate to in my experience. Perhaps it's time to cut yourself some slack. I can't really say; only you can decide that. 💔",3,jzwdbe7,,1694310348

Timing Methotrexate and Orencia (or any biologic),post,"Hi everyone,

First post for me! Have had RA since 2014, and have been on methotrexate (weekly injection) and biologic (weekly injection) combo since fall of that year. First Humira for about 5 years, now orencia injection the last 4.

My question is about timing your meds. I have my own routine I’ve developed but recently I wondered what others routines were. 

How do you folks time your meds with a mtx/biologic combo? Do you take the on the same day? Do you take one, then the other the next day? Different times through the week? And where does your folic acid supplement fit in?

Just curious to how others approach this combo therapy. It’s been nearly a decade and I honestly don’t recall what the order should be 🤷‍♀️. What I do seems to work fine but I really would love to know what others do!

Humira starting to work?,post,"I’m trying not to get my hopes up, but after my 3rd dose of Humira, I had the energy and strength to do a little bit more again. I did some chores that have been piling up, and didn’t pay a penalty for it the next day! Then I started hurting again a few days before the 4th dose. Took that Monday, and energy came back.

I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis two years ago after testing positive for borellia a short time before.
It manifests itself in the form of a swollen knee that doesn't cause me any pain but does limit my mobility.
The doctor has now advised me to start MTX.
I'm not sure if that's too early, since I don't have any pain. Also, my wife and I want to have a child.

Medications,post,Curious on others results compared to mine. My rheum started me on MTX right after diagnosis but it wasn’t making a difference and then I learned there were other options that didn’t hinder me trying for a baby (I’m 30 and in a long term relationship) I asked if I could switch to either sulfasalzine or hydroxyclorquine. He was very apprehensive about it (weirdly not apprehensive about telling someone at child bearing age about other medications that don’t affect fertility) but he did prescribe both medications to take together. He said that usually even both meds together aren’t as good as MTX but at this point potentially having a baby is more important to me. Just wondering others experiences on mtx vs. Sulfasalzine and hydroxyclorquine in effectiveness. I have not had side effects of concern from any of these meds so that isn’t part of my question.

Medications,comment,"My rheum started me on MTX after diagnosis, but it raised my liver enzymes too much. I tried Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), but discontinued it due to heavy menstrual periods. Finally he put me on Imuran (azathioprine) and I had no side effects. It doesn't seem to be commonly used as an RA DMARD, but it is an option. 

As for effectiveness, I have taken these medications in addition to a biologic, so it's difficult for me to assess what effect they would have had alone. I tried several biologics and didn't have much success with effectiveness until Actemra.

Anyway, my quick google search (obviously I'm not a doctor) seems to indicate that Imuran is safe for fertility/pregnancy so maybe that's something you could ask your rheum about. Or you could try to find another rheum who is more considerate of your needs.

LDN for RA- vitamins- vaccinations?,post,"Hey guys ❤️ Apologies in advance for the long post. 

I was officially dx’d just a few weeks ago w/ seronegative RA. Took some time to really process; I’m glad to finally have an answer. 

My rheumy started w/ Plaquenil, and 5 days in I developed Steven Johnson Syndrome and had to stop. (Sulfasalazine poses the same risk). 

Fast forward to a wk and a half ago, we decided to trial low dose naltrexone for multiple other comorbidites- MTX if this doesn’t work. (I have adrenal PCOS, hypothyroidism, I suspect Sjögren’s syndrome but my rheumy will draw labs in a few months to R/O). I’m really sensitive to meds- started at 0.25mg & so far I’m up to .75 w/ my rheumys permission & it’s actually helping. 🤞🏽🤞🏽

My 1st question, for those that have been successful on LDN w/ RA, how do you know what the “sweet spot is”? Should pain be “reasonably low level tolerable” or should it be completely gone?! 🤷🏽‍♀️

2nd question, I started fish oil. I’ve read diff/ posts in the community that vitamins are/aren’t recommended for our already over reactive immune system? I take vit D 50,000 units- & the fatigue/brain fog was so bad that I started a MVI. I wondered about turmeric and fish oil- (1 versus the other? Together?🤷🏽‍♀️), and CoQ10. I’ve noticed months leading up to that my body had a harder time fighting things- for the last 2 weeks my body was trying to fight going into a full blown cold. Leading to my 3rd question… 

What’s y’all’s opinion on flu vaccines? 

Random 4th question- my scalp itches. At 1st I thought I was nuts until I seen similar post in this community about that symptom. I’ve tried every hair oil under the sun, tea tree/peppermint- LDN gives me vivid dreams- I dreamt I had lice last night if that tells you anything 🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤣.  I’ve had my husband look and my scalp is clean, no redness, no irritation, just itchy. Any suggestions? 

Always welcome to any suggestions, and really thankful for this community! 🙏🏽",3,1752yl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/1752yl5/ldn_for_ra_vitamins_vaccinations/,1696990351

What happens if mtx is taken once a week but on different days?,comment,"It depends on what kind of different days you're talking about and how often you do this. 

If you are switching it around a lot then your doses of the medication won't be evenly spaced. It's generally going to be prescribed intending you to take it every 7 days so if you keep switching the days it's going to be more or less than that but never as the doctor ordered. At best you might just not have the optimal dosage in your body all the time, but also you could have toxicity issues. If this week you take it on Friday or Saturday and then next week you take it Monday that's probably too close together.

But if you're talking about if you forget on your normal Tuesday once in a while and then take it on that Wednesday, I'd say probably not a big deal.",1,jis3tz7,,1683166095

RA and Bone Fracture,post,"51F seronegative RA diagnosed about 1.5 years ago. Seven weeks ago I twisted my foot on the stairs and broke my fifth metatarsal. Ortho recommended letting it heal in a walking boot with crutches/scooter. I stopped taking MTX immediately. At six weeks there was no new bone formation so he did surgery to repair the bone with a plate and screws. I am now one week post op. 
The questions; has anyone dealt with fractures and non-union of fractures? What was your experience? Are we more prone to slow or non healing due to the RA? Will the hardware cause any issues relating to RA?
I have to say my joints feel better than they have in a long time. As a housecleaner I usually suffer constant pain in my wrists, hands, and elbows. The time off of work has done wonders for my body. Not so much for my bank account, but the rest and relaxation has been amazing!

RA and Bone Fracture,comment,"Sorry to hear you broke that bone. I've had JRA a very long time and broke my fifth metatarsal more than 20 years ago. I've heard of quite a few others who have fractured the same bone as well.

My ortho also recommended waiting awhile to see if it would heal. Like you mine failed to fuse after a number of weeks but quit hurting as well. So, my doctor didn't really see a need for surgery, and we just left it alone. He checked it months later, it still hadn't fused but my pain never returned either. AFAIK, it's never healed.

To the best of my knowledge, RA and other disorders can inhibit healing of bone fractures. Apparently, immune cells play an important role in healing. Here's a PubMed abstract about this topic:

[Fracture healing under healthy and inflammatory conditions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22293759/)

I would be really surprised if your doctor would use any type of hardware likely to cause problems. It's probably titanium, I'm full of titanium from joint replacements and a fracture or two, and I've had no problems with it.

Methotrexate & Remicade - Other options with Remicade? Differences between subcutaneous mtx and pill form?,post,"Hi there. I also have ulcerative colitis. My rheumatologist upped my dosage of methotrexate which has helped a lot with my joint pain, but is now causing issues with my UC. I’m currently taking the methotrexate in pill form. My gastroenterologist says I should stop taking the methotrexate (as it’s been a year and is causing me issues) and consult my rheumatologist for my joint pain, but my rheumatologist is pushing to stay on the methotrexate and go from pill form to subcutaneous injections saying there won’t be as much side effects 

For those of you who have done both pill form and subcutaneous injections of methotrexate, have you noticed less side effects? If not, what medications are working for you? 

I’m currently on Remicade which has helped subdue my UC. I would ideally like to stick to Remicade as my UC was quite bad before. Entyvio did not work for me after a month or two. 

If you are on Remicade with another medication to help reduce your joint pain, would you mind sharing with me?

"Methofen( methocarbamol+ ibuprofen) got me very dizzy lightheaded, disoriented, sweating a lot, unable to sleep on 2 pills per day only…",comment,"I started on Methocarbamol as the first medication for my fibromyalgia and other pain. I was also told to take ibuprofen or naproxen with it. I tried both of those with it but those seemed to just give me side effects and not a lot of help. (Plus you have to be very mindful of your ibuprofen/naproxen intake so you don't give yourself stomach ulcers)

Have you tried just taking the methocarbamol by itself, with naproxen, or with Tylenol instead? I also noticed that if I took the methocarbamol doses too close together I started to get side effects from it, so be mindful of how close together you are taking the doses. I've also found that cutting them in half and spreading the medication out over the day can sometimes help.

I'm starting on Mtx in about a week so I don't have that drug interaction that you do. I'm not sure what dosage you are on since you didn't mention it, but ""6 pills, twice per day"" sounds rather high. For comparison, I'm 27 with RA and fibromyalgia and I'm prescribed ""one 500mg pill 3 times a day."" I know the dosages for methocarbamol can be safely prescribed relatively high but there is no reason to start out the gate at a higher dose. My doctor originally started me on 500mg 2xday and then bumped me to the 3xday after trying it for a month or so.

Hopefully my personal experience helps you some. Having been recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia and RA, I'm quickly realizing there is a bit of a learning curve but not a lot of great literature to learn from.",2,jmlfobx,,1685701025

"Fairly Quiet RA, but Iritis Flares",post,"Male-40s, looking for others' experience or general discussion on my issue. 

I have been on plaquenil for over 5 years. Started on it about 6 months after having the feeling of sprained fingers and blood testing positive for Anti-CCP and elevators RF. I'm also HLA-B27+ but imaging does not show any signs of spinal inflammation, however I do have neck pain when sleeping that causes bad headaches. Best medical assumption by the doc from radiology report is mild cervical stenosis. I take 400mg ibuprofen a night for this to avoid the headache. 

I've been having iritis about once or twice a year since the onset of RA (was the first symptom I experienced about 3 months prior to joint pain). Other than some mild achiness in my MCP joint a couple of time a year my RA has been pretty quiet, and my eyes probably bother me more. 

I usually have a bout of iritis once or twice a year which requires pred drops for about a week or two. I have had 4 peripheral corneal ulcers in 5 years as well which require anti-biotic drops. I always feel like my eyes are dry and OTC drops only help for a few minutes. Doc says I do not have clinically dry eye. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and my lid is pretty much stuck on my eye ball. 

My rheumatologist suggests starting MTX. My eye doc hasn't really suggested a change in treatment. 

I'm pretty much deciding to go for MTX. How has it worked for others with Iritis? Any hope it might help with the neck pain too?",5,17e7mkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/17e7mkp/fairly_quiet_ra_but_iritis_flares/,1698020821
"Fairly Quiet RA, but Iritis Flares",comment,"i have had a few iritis (acute anterior uveitis) flare ups with my juvenile arthritis. nothing for a few years now fortunately as i have a better medication regime (humira, leflunomide, naproxen). i also have extremely dry eye but that’s probably unrelated (i think lol). 

when i was dealing with these flare ups and changing meds, my rheumatologist made a point to try meds that would help the eyes. i went on methotrexate which really helped (flare up of iritis basically stopped after that) and later switched to humira bc of methotrexate side effects. 

plaquenil can negatively affect the eyes and doesn’t really help iritis specifically. speaking from juvenile arthritis experience (which is similar to RA, a little bit different pathology and less med options but the common ones are the same) - methotrexate is the first line of treatment for the eyes. humira (biologic) is also particularly good among the different types of biologics for treating iritis. also remicade (biologic only available as an infusion) is good. for kids, this would be the order to treat in (try methotrexate, then humira, then remicade), but most (60-82%) see improvement with methotrexate. 

overall, your rheumatologist should be the one treating your iritis (at least the root cause, your arthritis). the eye doctor can’t do too much besides reactive treatment, aka treat it with steroids when it flares up. methotrexate is a logical and typical next step suggested by your dr to treat the arthritis-associated iritis. 

for context, i am 18F, last had an iritis flare up when i was 14. probably not a relevant study for you but the source for the medication information: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5082254/",2,k62ircb,,1698039196
"Fairly Quiet RA, but Iritis Flares",comment,"I'm sorry you're dealing with this. This is a post I did awhile ago:

A few years ago, I was watching TV with a friend and there was a commercial for Restasis. I totally made fun of it. A prescription for *dry eyes*? Ridiculous! 
For the past few years I have been using a lot of eye drops. I brushed it off as allergies, side effects from neuro meds, or just one of the joys of aging. 
This past January I was at my opthalmologist for my Plaquinel/ hydroxychloroquine check up, and she put me on Restasis. It took several weeks to start working, but I am floored at how different - and better!! - my eyes feel. I didn't even realize how uncomfortable they were.
Imagine my surprise to learn that Restasis is, at it's core, an anti-inflammatory drug. According to the Arthritis Foundation dry eyes are common among people with autoimmune issues (RA, Sjogren's, lupus). ""The same autoantibodies that attack your joints can target your eyes, preventing normal tear production"". 
So, get your eyes checked! Especially if you are experiencing tired, sore, or dry eyes.
EDIT: like so many of our meds Restasis is pricey. Here's how I get mine [abbvie assist Restasis ](https://www.abbvie.com/patients/patient-support/patient-assistance/eligibility-criteria.html)

Do you see an optometrist or an opthalmologist? The latter is trained to manage more serious conditions, but if you're already seeing an opthalmologist it might be a good idea to find a new one. RA (even when it's ""fairly quiet"") is always working against us. Far too often we have to advocate for ourselves because our medical professionals aren't able or willing to listen and treat us properly.

I'm in a *bad* flare so I do still have pain, swelling and fatigue but it's much better than before. 
No hair loss since I increased to 3mg folic acid.

The only downsides for me have been how slow they are to work- 4-6 weeks for each, and mtx causes me to have nausea that lasts 3-6 days after injection so I may have to take less or give it up.

Edit cuz I misread your post: humira has less noticeable side effects than mtx for sure. For me the day after mtx injection is always a lay in bed kinda day so def take it easy.

Do you have an appointment with a rheumatologist yet?

I take 15 mg meloxicam (max dosage) daily and get significant benefit for my pain and stiffness. As an NSAID, meloxicam should provide help quickly (within days) if it works for you. What is your dosage in mg?

Beyond that, as Consistent-Process stated, contact your PCP's office, explain how much trouble you're having, and ask for some prednisone (steroids) to help in the short term.

I'm very sorry you're going through so much pain at the moment and also that you've been diagnosed with RA at such a young age. Life truly is very unfair. ☹️ Hang in there. In time your pain will improve, hopefully fairly quickly if you can get started with some prednisone.

Unable to bend legs.,comment,"Oh! I should mention that some doctors get a little nervous about prescribing steroids without consulting the rheumatologist. This is because long term side effects of using them *frequently* are bad. It's also because rheumatology is a complex disease that a lot of GP's don't feel comfortable dealing with at all without the rheumatologist signing off on every move. 

Push 'em for it anyway. If they won't give you some call the rheumatologist's office and explain how bad it is and that you need to be able to move before you have your first appointment. They won't be able to prescribe it since they haven't seen you. 

HOWEVER the rheumatologist is going to be more familiar with how debilitating it is. So you can likely get their office to call your GP's office and tell them to give it to you. The phone tag is frustrating, but learn from my years of experience. There is often a way to get around going untreated. If the GP refuses, make sure to tell them that you would like their refusal noted on your chart and you'd like a copy.

Granted, this can burn a bridge so it's a last ditch effort, but suddenly if it's actually going to be in writing that they *refused* to treat you, a lot of doctors get a lot more helpful.

Unable to bend legs.,comment,"I do have experience with Meloxicam and it didn't to a thing for me. However, you haven't been on it long enough to tell whether or not it's working, sadly. It CAN start working in a few weeks. It's usually more realistic to think in terms of months.

**Unfortunately the problem with RA is that most of the drugs to treat it can take anywhere from 3 months to a year to start working. My current medication takes two years to reach it's full potential.**

I believe Meloxicam, if I remember correctly, is supposed to start working for ya anywhere from *3 weeks to six months*. 

You're probably on a pretty low dose since you haven't been seen by the specialist yet. So you may also want to ask about increasing the dosage as well. that's one where the higher the dose the faster it supposedly works. 

I wish I could say this isn't going to be a long and frustrating process, but it might be. Some people find the right meds for them in the first year. Some take several years. It took me a good 3 to find a medication cocktail that sorta worked well enough to stick with for a while. 

Partly the long process can be caused by the fact so many of these meds are often ones that can't be taken with each other. Not even traces of each other. So you then have to wait months for a medication to leave your system completely before trying the next (depending on what you and your doctor decide to try).

So hang in there. I know 2 months seems like forever when you're in this much pain, but while I'd love to tell you it'll all be okay once you see the specialist, it's more likely you need to re-frame your expectations. This could take a while. 

The nice thing is there are a lot of options. There are also lots of meds that absolutely can be stacked to work together and increase the effectiveness in combination. Most people I know have ended up needing more than one. So hang in there!

Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,post,"So I’ve had RA since November 2021. In that time, I have tried every traditional DMARD that they make, none of which worked well enough or caused unbearable side effects. I just took my second dose of Humira on Monday, but that takes time to work. My pain has been worsening, to the point where I can’t hardly use my hands, I grew a nodule on my pinky, and I think I’m getting Sjorgen’s syndrome. I am on max dose meloxicam, but it isn’t helping my pain much. 

My question is this: if you can’t take steroids, opioids, or low-dose naltrexone… is there anything else that would work to relieve some pain? I’m considering getting some marijuana edibles to last until the Humira kicks in, but am not thrilled about that idea.

Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,comment,"My rheumies have always described RA treatment as a three tiered approach:

1) treat the RA, including preventing additional damage to joints and organs with DMARDS, TNF inhibitors, antimalarials, etc. 

2) treat inflammation, often with prescription anti-inflammatories and anti-histamines .

3) treat PAIN with OTC and prescription medications, including medical marijuana.

For example, my prescription cocktail includes: 

1. HCQ & MTX (when needed)
2. Mobic (aka Meloxicam) & Zyrtec
3. Gabapentin, Medical Marijuana & Tramadol (when needed), Voltaren gel, CBD lotion

I also take a host of prescribed vitamins, minerals and supplements for lab tested deficiencies and absorption issues (I also have IBS-D).

Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,comment,"I take Relafen every single day, which has done wonders. On those rare days that I have break through pain, I take three Tylenol arthritis. I have really high pain tolerance so I can't say necessarily if the pain is actually gone or if it just drops enough that I no longer notice it. But I'm certainly functional now that I'm taking Relafen daily.

The only problem with taking marijuana is you don't know how it will interact with your medications. I asked my rheumatologist about a year ago what he thought of CBD oil, because I am not willing to use marijuana as is, not even in edible form. I've never done drugs, I spent 20 years in the Army so the thought of doing drugs is just impossible to me. CBD felt like a heck of a stretch for me, honestly. He took my question seriously and explained to me that while he had anecdotally heard about how marijuana improved pain, there were no scientific studies demonstrating if it was actually effective or how the mechanism worked, and he couldn't tell me how it might interact with humira. I am not willing to risk making my joints worse for CBD, so I have never attempted it. You can try talking to your rheumatologist, but as far as I know no proper, clinical double-blind scientific studies have been done regarding the effects of marijuana on RA or how it interacts with medications. I don't know if that's a risk you want to take. 

Other people on here might have personal experience they can tell you about.

PS - I also have a severe opiates allergy, so I can't take anything in that entire class of medication. So when I tell you something that I'm taking, you don't have to worry it'll interact with opiates, because I can't have them.",1,iuwul0r,,1667492989
Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,comment,"There really isn’t anything else, except maybe kratom? It is a natural herb that acts as an opioid but isn’t and a lot of people have had success with it. But as far as pharmaceutical things you have exhausted every option for pain. Cannabis gives me severe anxiety but it could also help pain, but I can’t use it. But I know for a lot of people it helps alot. If you don’t mind me asking what other health issues would prevent opioid or at the very least steroid use? And be careful with meloxicam and other NSAIDS, if they aren’t helping and you’re taking a lot they can cause stomach bleeds and Ulcers. Other possible things you could try to ask for is maybe, benzodiazepines some of them like Valium or klonopin can be used as muscle relaxants. Or have you tried actual muscle relaxers like flexiril, methocarbamol?

Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,comment,"Yeah, I read the whole post. 

You describe a constellation of worrisome symptoms BEFORE you get to the pain medication question and only describe being on a single med (Humira) currently in the original post.

When you commented with a list of additional meds, of COURSE I had to ask again - what are you taking, because there may have been additional meds you hadn't mentioned the first time. Or the second. 

Humira should, in time, keep that rheumatoid nodule in check. Fwiw, I have them as well, in my left inner elbow. Damn thing is like a Butterball turkey pop up. 

You can't take:

>steroids, opioids, or low-dose naltrexone

But I don't know if this is because of legal reasons (i.e. lab testing for employment), allergies or other contraindications (like heart disease, etc.), seizure disorder, depression, pulmonary disease, CYP2D6 enzymes, or other concerns, medication interactions, pregnancy, addiction, etc. 

That's a pretty big list of ""No's"" right there. And given I'm NOT a pharmacology specialist, sorting out WHAT they have in common that might have triggered them to be on the same list is a Herculean task. 

So it's nearly impossible to recommend something. So I went back to the treatment constellation - proper wide spectrum treatment SHOULD lessen your pain. Won't completely wipe it out, but it will help. 

Fwiw, I'm a former Medical Marijuana agent. I take Medibles (aka Marijuana Edibles) nearly daily. They work wonderfully for me and many people. I used to vape and smoke, but given the pandemic and Covid-19 attacking people's lungs, I've ceased that in case I manage to catch Covid (so far, I have NOT). 

I would highly recommend you try Voltaren gel. It's available OTC. 

Additionally, I would highly recommend considering an SSRI or SNRI - chronic pain rewires the brain. A lot of great science has proven that treating chronic pain patients with anti-depressives helps us with pain. When my rheumy put me on Wellbutrin, it dialed down my pain tremendously. 

I have found a TENS unit to be particularly useful for non-joint pain. Depending on whether you have inter-muscular pain or can handle this sort of thing, you may find it useful. I also use infrared heat pads, which I adore. 

I also recommend to you a marvelous book called the Pain Chronicles by Melanie Thernstrom. It is the only book on PAIN written by a chronic pain patient I know of.",7,iuwtgst,,1667492559

There are only 2 pain clinics here, and the other gets 1 star reviews all the time so I’m not interested in going there. But this pain clinic I’ve been going to didn’t review any of my non-RA meds before suggesting opioids, and they had me do a UA, but they do the panel themselves and it takes 2 weeks to get the results.

Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,comment,"Thankfully there are vegan options, either by vegan companies or vegan options within medible companies.

Unfortunately, most medible companies are locally based and do not get involved in interstate commerce due to the Federal jurisdiction issues (not to mention banking issues). 

Your best bet is to check [leafly.com](https://leafly.com) and [weedmaps.com](https://weedmaps.com) for your local dispensaries and check their medible listings, then look for either VEGAN icons or a subcategory for vegan options. You may be able to order ahead, which is your safest option, given you have time to research yourself. 

When I ran our stores' listings, I always added icons for these - a sold circle with a capitol V shadowed out. Other stores/brands may use their own, but at the time, that's what the industry was using.

A good dispensary agent should be able to help you, as well. But you'll have to check ingredients at your dispensary to verify for Pectin.

Unbearable Pain w/ No Relief,comment,"I also have a lot of trouble with steroids. It makes my bipolar go totally wonky but it’s on the agitated hypomanic end. However, I talked to my psychiatrist and she has given me some extra seroquel if needed. I have no idea if that is your issue or whether it would help you but I am just mentioning it. Also, I have gotten tramadol and opioids at the ER. They can clearly see when I’m in that amount of intense pain. Unfortunately the tramadol didn’t work for me but the opioids do. They give me like a 10 day script usually so it’s just enough to give the other meds time to work. I’m so sorry you’re in so much pain and I really hope you can get some relief soon.

Edit: just read your post OP about being bipolar. I agree with the other poster that a lot of bipolar people take pain meds! If you haven’t tried the ER head over there if you can!

Is seronegative rheumatoid arthritis really a thing?,post,"I’m tired of being in pain. I’ve been living on meloxicam and I don’t think I can keep taking it because my belly is starting to get unwell. I feel deflated.

I finally had my first rheumatologist appointment today to investigate probable seronegative RA. My GP is knowledgeable and I have X-rays suggesting it. Which is why I was referred.
When I was physically assessed the rheumatologist could tell I was in pain and was apologetic. He seems like a lovely man. He then went through my pathology and declared that it’s not rheumatoid because my rheumatoid factor and all the other markers aside from a low level ANA (speckled) are negative. I have to get an MRI before he can consider even consider medications for a non-auto immune joint condition. I’ve got another month of being in pain before I could get some help.


I guess I just want to know what indicates ‘seronegative’ RA and what makes it clear that I definitely don’t have it? I’m not unhappy with his professionalism. But I feel like I left the very expensive appointment with less answers than when I went in. Ultimately he is the specialist, but my GP is very knowledgeable due to her previous medical career and I believed her… but now that the specialist has said no, I’m second guessing myself and wondering if I just clung to her advice because it explained all my symptoms.

Is seronegative rheumatoid arthritis really a thing?,comment,"Was there swelling when you got the MRI? Because MRI would pick up signs of RA if there was swelling. And you need swelling to have an inflammatory arthritis. 

If there wasn't swelling, then there's two options 

1. This isn't RA or really any kind of inflammatory arthritis 
2. This may be something called palindromic rheumatisms, which is when swelling is acute in onset lasting for hours to days and then it goes away. Comes and goes in this fashion. 

For number 2, does this sound like what you're having? Does the swelling come and go, but doesn't persist? 

Number 2 is generally unlikely, very rare, and to have it be seronegative on top of it like in your case would make it even harder to diagnose. 

The good news (in a way) with palindromic rheumatism is that in a certain proportion of patients they will go on to develop full blown RA, whereas the rest of the patients this should spontaneously get better. 

So if you notice the swelling sticking around for weeks to months and at a time, you just revisit your rheumatologist.

I'm sorry you are going through this, I know this isn't easy.",1,jd2e6es,,1679394914

I don't understand who gave you this med, but you deserve an explanation. I have OA and cero-negative RA. It may sound crazy, but I have found they have two very different kinds of pain. They each have discrete times to flare, and I would bet that's why you aren't feeling any relief. I don't understand why you don't feel any benefits from naproxen, except that you're trying to conquer mammoth sized pain with a slingshot (please forgive the clunky analogy). But no matter what you should stop taking it regularly because it can cause a lot of damage (stomach, liver, kidneys....impt stuff). More bad news: grad school is probably going to flare the crap out of you. When I started my PhD, I got shingles. It's such a huge undertaking! They start off telling you that you will likely fail, then try to kill you 😂😂 I loved grad school! But you need to start that journey with good health and your feet on the ground.

I Have Some Questions ...,post,"Hi everyone, I am here because something is going on with my joints and I am so frustrated. I am not asking for a diagnosis but wanted to see if any of this makes sense to anyone ... 

I am 44 years old, generally healthy, no hereditary reason to think I have RA. Over the last 3-4 years though, I have had more and more problems with my joints, specifically my hands. They never LOOK swollen, but they often feel swollen and fingers feel harder to bend than normal. My thumb joints, wrists, and knuckles specifically are painful, and I feel like the strength in my hands is leaving me. I drop things a lot without meaning to do that, and fine motor tasks seem harder all the time. Hands do not stay warm in winter no matter what I do, and they always seem dry (though not like psoriasis or eczema dry) no matter how much lotion I use. I have tingling in my fingertips and recently, both elbows have been bothering me. The right side is worse, but both sides are affected. 

I saw a rheumatologist last year who sort of looked at me crazy, did a couple of ultrasounds, and then sent me on my way with meloxicam. I left with the general impression that she did not believe me and that she thinks I am basically overreacting to normal osteoarthritis. My PCP ran some bloodwork for me and I do not have blood markers for RA or any other autoimmune thing that the panel tested for. In addition to osteoarthritis, I have been diagnosed with tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, tenosynovitis, and trigger finger. Carpal tunnel was then ruled out after a nerve conduction test came back normal, so I did skip what would have been an unnecessary surgery. I have a variety of braces and compression sleeves/gloves and nothing seems to make a huge difference. Have been to hand therapy and while paraffin wax is very relaxing, the pain in my joints remains. The meloxicam seems to be less effective now as well. 

I have an appointment with a new rheumatologist on Monday and I guess what I want to know is--what do I say? How do I a) get someone to take me seriously and b) what do I need to ask for? I have had x-rays that show nothing except mild osteoarthritis, but no one has done an MRI, so I think maybe that is what needs to happen next. Also, should I consider seeing another orthopedist? Ortho was who originally diagnosed all the musculoskeletal issues I listed above. Does anyone have any similar experience?

"newly diagnosed, med questions",comment,"I'm also relatively young and on meloxicam. It's one of the only anti inflammatories that don't give me unmanageable side effects. On it's own, it doesn't help a lot but that would also depend on your dosage. Methotrexate is one of the faster working RA meds and you can expect results within a month, give or take. Others can take up to 4 months to start working. The side effects aren't great but if you time it right, they're manageable. Give yourself a day or two to rest off the effects of each dose at first until you're more familiar with it. There aren't any RA meds that don't have side-effects, unfortunately, and mtx's can be managed with folic acid.

As for the drinking, that's just the reality of meds. Especially RA meds. Ideally, you shouldn't drink with any of them. Most of them interact poorly with alcohol. You can occasionally drink with mtx, just not within 2 or so days of taking a dose. Mtx is metabolized in the liver and drinking only strains your liver more. Prednisone is a corticosteroid and should not be taken with alcohol. Alcohol affects how well it works and can make underlying conditions worse. Most meds mean cutting out alcohol. I know it sucks, especially when you're young. But it's a matter of priority. If you want to keep drinking, consider cutting back a lot. Drinking isn't great but you can still do it if you're doing so in moderation. But consider this, there's no cure for RA yet. All we can do is slow down it's progression. For us younger people, that means we'll be living with it for decades and living on meds for it for decades. That means taking care of your body more than anyone else, especially your liver. A lot of meds are already harsh on your liver. Like my dr said, it doesn't need extra strain. It's a harsh thing to think about but that's the reality of this diagnosis.",8,jh9o9v3,,1682170766

"newly diagnosed, med questions",comment,"Hello! I was diagnosed at 19 and was put on prednisone (5mg daily), methotrexate (20mg weekly) and hydroxychloroquine. Methotrexate changed my life - I went from being in pain every day to eventually only having flares maybe once a fortnight. And then I cut out gluten and only had flares when I fucked up and ate Bread (lol). I stayed on a low dose of prednisone for a while with the intention of going off it once the methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine kicked in. But I ended up having to stay on a low dose (2.5mg) for about 7 years because it was hard to wean off without pain. I never had any severe methotrexate side effects at all. A little fatigue, some nausea in the 24hrs after taking it so now I take it in the evening so I can sleep most of it off. But nothing severe at all. It’s been a game changer for me in combination with he other meds. I feel a bit silly because when I was diagnosed I was so desperate to have relief I didn’t read any information about any side effects, oops. But it ended up working out for me 😂 
Sorry about your diagnosis it really sucks having to deal with such a painful disease so young. 
Also as far as I’m aware meloxicam is just an anti inflammatory (NSAID) NOT an immunosuppressant medication. Therefore isn’t likely do actually do much but mask a little bit of the pain. You need to be on immunosuppressive medication to halt the progression of the disease and prevent joint deformation in the future.

I personally had a bad reaction to the drug, i had to take off 2 days of work, but my boss was super understanding. my dr stopped methotrexate after that reaction. it’s worth trying bc it really helps a lot of people- and i try to keep that as my mindset as i try new drugs. as for drinking… RA meds really forced me to drink less bc i don’t want to kill my liver/kidneys, BUT there are a lot of RA drugs you can drink on",1,jhajkdm,,1682184598

He does however tell people to follow their gut feelings and in his newest book “The Myth Of Normal” in ch27 he shares the experiences of people who overcame their chronic diseases who both refused treatment and accepted it but the common thread between the two of them is that it was their choice they made authentically. Not something they were pressured into doing. You must have a very strong inclination to heal and get better before ever attempting what I and some others have done.,1,jhhtbyy,,1682322920

I have tried Plaquenil (caused long QT syndrome), sulfasalazine (worked a tiny bit and then stopped - I’m still taking this at max dose), methotrexate (triggers an insane amount of hair loss and severe depression/suicidal thoughts), tried leflunomide (also caused hair loss and didn’t help at all), then I tried Humira (didn’t work), next was Rinvoq, which worked well until I had to stop taking it for 3 weeks for a major surgery, and now it’s not working at all after 3 months of being back on it.

I also take max dose of meloxicam twice daily, and cannot take corticosteroids due to causing severe depression and suicidal ideation almost immediately.

These occipital neuralgia headaches are so debilitating,post,"Just got diagnosed with RA Feb 23rd after two years of pain with no answer, so I am actually very happy about getting an answer and starting medication. I started hydroxychloroquine Feb 23rd and it’s going to take a few months to kick in. 

My joint pain is definitely uncomfortable, limits my daily activities, and makes me very fatigued. But I can deal with all of this for a few more months while the medicine kicks in. 

The most debilitating symptom that I cannot deal with is the chronic neck pain and tension that has led to occipital neuralgia (compression of the occipital nerves at the base of the skull). These headaches leave me sweating, shaking, nauseous/puking, dizzy, crying, and unable to leave my bed all day. They only go away with excedrin extra strength which doesn’t even work sometimes. They don’t happen daily but I never know if I’ll wake up with one 

I saw a neurologist as a recommendation by my rheumatologist before diagnosing me with RA. neurologist said the headaches are from super tight neck muscles and compression of the nerves. She gave me numbing injections and I also had just started meloxicam so the headaches went away temporarily

I’m no longer on meloxicam, I was on it from Jan 23 to Feb 23. I finished a week long pack of  prednisone  about a week ago (because I was having the headaches) and now the headaches are back. I had one today and I’m scared of when the next one will come.

I have seronegative RA,  and have had to switch up meds a number of times. I am doing well, but I wouldn't say I'm in remission. Even though I have some pain, my joints are still pretty clear of degeneration. Any one else on this subReddit would have their own experiences. It is upsetting news, and does cause a lot of anxiety about the future.  But, the meds available to us are really good. Sometimes it takes awhile to get the right one, you may find a good one then it stops working for you and you have to make a change. You may notice you have triggers that can send you into a flare up -  alcohol, too much processed food, stress, not enough sleep, a sudden change in the weather. It varies from person to person. The best thing you can do is control what you can - take your meds, eat healthy, rest when you need to, find a form of exercise that helps but doesn't stress your joints. As time goes on you will figure out what works best for you. Make sure you feel comfortable with your Rheumatologist and they listen to you. Ask a million questions, read postings on this subReddit for info. Be prepared for most other people to not understand what RA is or what you are going through. Seek support where you can.

"26F, just diagnosed. What can I expect?",comment,"It's pretty upsetting. 

Seronegative is harder to treat than Seropositive and we often have different symptoms, as well. And we generally have more inflammation and disease activity. It's incredibly important to stay on treatment, when you experience a Flare that lasts more than a few days - get in to an Urgent Care or PCP to get treatment for it. If you are having more than one Flare every three months, you report that to your rheumy. 

Understand that it's likely going to take a few treatment options, including multiple medications taken at once, before you find what works for you. And even then, as the years progress you'll likely need to switch up a bit. Additionally, seronegative can develop into seropositive, though that's not very common. 

Unfortunately, there's no way to predict long term outcomes. Stay on treatment! Even a month of treatment delay has shown considerably worse outcomes after 2 years.",5,j1m8zse,,1671982501
"26F, just diagnosed.

My best advice is to try to figure out which foods cause flares for you most often and take them out of your diet, but also to keep a lot of prepared foods you know are safe for you on hand, freeze portions of meals in the freezer and meal prep. Because there’s going to be so many times you’ll be unable to cook for yourself and if you end up ordering food you’ll just get stuck in the cycle of ordering because you feel bad and then feeling bad because of what you ordered (depending on your dietary restrictions), I’d also say that you should always try to have a back up plan when your meeting up with friends, family, an so because there’s gonna be times when you won’t feel well enough to be walking around or standing for a long period of time, I live in Florida so I always use the beach as my default because I can just sit in a chair and relax and swim if I’m up for it which always helps the joints.

Waiting on diagnosis and I am so overwhelmed and in so much pain.,post,"Hi everyone. About a week and a half ago my right knee started swelling out of no where and at first there was no pain and about 3 days in it started to hurt excruciatingly. I can’t walk, put any weight on it or even just relax my knee muscles. My knee is huge. 2 days ago I finally managed to see my orthopedic surgeon for a follow-up on 3 herniated discs I’ve been suffering from the last 2 months which had me bed ridden and in excruciating pain. He also took a look at my knee and just kept saying “wow that’s so swollen “ he then stuck a needle in and extracted a little bit of yellow fluid all while saying wow there is so much and your swollen. Then he injected me with some steroids and ordered me to go get an X-ray done and come back in a week to follow up. I asked him what he thought it might be and he said rheumatoid arthritis and basically walked out of the room. It was all in all a horrible visit and he couldn’t have been bothered to explain anything just rushed me on through. Which is whatever at this point. My knee is still super swollen and the pain is out of control, I am taking vicodin currently and meloxicam which work fine for a few hours. When is the steroid supposed to start working? What can I do in the meantime to help ease the pain and swelling? I am so overwhelmed and frustrated I can’t stop crying. I know this isn’t a “death” sentence and can be managed long term after doing some research but right now I am just at the end of my rope and this all feel alike a nightmare, I’ve been in so much pain everyday for the last 2 months between herniated disc’s, swollen painful ankles a few weeks ago I’m just really struggling and am in a really dark place!

Waiting on diagnosis and I am so overwhelmed and in so much pain.,comment,"Changing your diet and exercise is great going forward but doesn't offer immediate relief .   Do you have medical Marijuana dispensaries nearby? Send a good friend over to request some gummies that will diminish the pain without getting you stupid high.  Was so much help for me, allowed me to sleep again and tolerate the waiting until I got on the right meds to control this RA.

I wouldn't take it with another pain drug, there's no need.

Also, steriod shots don't always work for everyone.  But by end of the first week you would normally feel a good difference. 

Drink tons of water. Shocking how much simply  drinking sufficient amounts of water can reduce swelling and just make you feel better.

I'm sorry you're in this position,  I've  been there and oh God it sucked. Describing it as a ""dark place"" seems overly polite.  It will pass tho.",6,ivbr6zu,,1667765823

When my knee is swollen and acting up, I use a compression knee brace and it helps me a lot. Keeps the swelling down and take a lot of pressure off. But you seems to have a lot of water, for the lack of a better term, on the knee.  Steroids usually worked for me in 24-36 hours. I started to feel a lot of relief. But then again, it was pill form.

Possible sero negative RA,post,"Symptom notes + blood work + medications

Hi y'all, I made a post a few days ago with the video of my swollen, red, hand. I was only able to post one video, but understand this is what is happening on both sides of my body. Also Ive been to my PCP and have had all kinds of preliminary bloodwork done, the results are as follows:
ANA: positive 
CCP: normal
CRT: normal
Sed rate: normal
Bilirubin: above normal range
Leukocytes: above normal range
Hemoglobin: low
All other results were mostly normal

So I am going to make a list of what has been happening month by month since all of this began, shortly after I contracted covid in February of this year.

2/22/23 recovering from covid. Knee pain begins. Headaches.
Take a week off of gym
due to extreme knee pain and extreme fatigue. Chalk it up to recovery from covid.
3/25/23 
Unable to regain previous gym activity, so I purchase a knee brace for both knees, pain and weakness spreads to both knees, neck, low back. Extreme fatigue. Headaches. Need a nap or several naps a day (not typical for me AT ALL)
4/09/23
Pain increases and I lose my footing going downstairs as my left knee buckles, pain now includes neck, hands, and left elbow. I broke my antique Japanese rice bowl when I lost my footing on Easter. Still experiencing fatigue and headaches. 
5/20/23
Pain now systemic and including feet. Extreme swelling, pain, tenderness. Several toes are now totally numb. Feels like I am touching someone elses toes. Noticeable brain fog, inability to focus on instructions from boss, messing up very simple recipes at work, frustrated with myself. Tired all the time. Headaches come and go on an almost daily basis. Dont have any energy after I come home from work. I just sleep most days. Pain in my feet is unbearable, buy Oofos shoes in the hopes that pain decreases.
6/10/23-present
Same complaints, systemic pain, extreme pain in feet, extreme fatigue, headaches. Same brain fog and inability to focus. Only one day of work causes severe foot pain for the remainder of the week. Things I try: ice foot soaks, epsom salt soaks, voltaren cream, foot massager, elevate feet after work. Unable to workout due to pain. Just walking becomes unbearable and extremities become noticeably swollen. Fatigued all the time. Gaining weight uncontrollably.
6/20/23
My big toe on my right side has a weird yellowish tinge to the skin. Begin taking vit B 12, multiple time a day, notice some improvements about 5 days in, continue taking vit B 12 everyday.
7/16/23
Woke up to swollen hands, feels like I have crab claws. Takes 45 min to make a fist. Hands swell up again after I come home from work. This continues every day. VERY painful. ZERO energy. I am just a zombie by this point. I barely have enough energy to make it through the work day and when I come home I crash out on the couch unable to move as I watch my body turn to stone night after night. This is my life now. My own personal HELL. I eat, sleep, and work. My poor husband has to pick up all the cooking and all the housework ontop of working a full time job. He has to assist me with trips to the bathroom because I am barely able to walk or pull up my pants without falling over.
8/17/23
A month later no changes other than I am noticing more areas are being affected and I am unable to continue to work as many hours so I make adjustments with work. Go to see PCP, explain symptoms and do bloodwork. Dr writes Rx for amitryptaline for possible fibromyalgia dx. 
9/01/23
No relief from amitryptaline and my PCP starts me on meloxicam. 10 days on meloxicam with no relief, symptoms growing worse by the day. Now I am unable to work more than 5 hrs per day. 
9/13/23 
So I go back to my PCP this time he gives me a prednisone taper. It is as follows:
4x 10mg pills, for 4 days
2x 10mg pills, for 4 days 
1x 10mg pills, for 4 days
9/14/23
So I take my first dose yesterday and I only took 1 pill (I was unaware that I was supposed to take them all at once, so I spaced them all 1 hr apart) but let me tell you... after only taking ONE 10mg pill, after 45 min ALL my swelling went down SIGNIFICANTLY. I was able to push myself up off the couch without pain in my hands or wrists, I was able to walk (not shuffle) to wherever I needed to go, my pain and swelling subsided almost instantaneously. 
9/15/23
I did wake up with my left hand swollen and stiff, but all other areas of my body were GOOD 👍🏼 I took all my 4 pills in the morning and got ready for work. I had energy, my pain was gone, and I was finally able to REALLY focus once again. That was so huge to feel like I was no longer suffering from early onset Alzheimer's. I might have over did it a tad today at work because my hands did get a little reddened by the end of my only 3 hr shift... but I plan on resting for the next 3 days at home so I can allow these steroids to do their thing as effectively as possible. I did swing by my PCPs office and showed him the ""look what I can do"" Stuart skit, he laughed and said ""Oooook lets not go crazy, I want you resting, but this tells me A LOT""

I visit my rheumatologist on October 16th. I am hoping that this prednisone keeps my pain and swelling at bay long enough to get me to my appointment.

So there thats it folks hope my notes have helped someone else who is going through this.",2,16jqn4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16jqn4u/possible_sero_negative_ra/,1694816199

What led to your diagnosis/what was your experience like?,post,"**Tldr**; PCP thinks it's RA and, after some research, I tend to agree. Still waiting for test results, but looking for advice--especially from other people diagnosed young.

Hi everyone.

I (22F) am facing a potential RA diagnosis and just wanted to hear what your experiences with diagnosis and early treatment were like.

A little background on me. I have a long history of joint pain/injury. I was a multi-sport athlete and acquired numerous knee, hip, and low-back injuries until I finally cut my losses when I tore my ACL at 17. Since then, I have struggled on and off with pain and inflammation, primarily in my knees, but I assumed it was just the after-effects of the many injuries.

In terms of my family, I don't know of any history of RA, but there are several autoimmune and endocrine problems on both sides. My dad had chronic knee and hip pain, but he didn't like doctors, so he never had it addressed. My mom herniated a disk in her lower back and has had chronic pain ever since. She was recently diagnosed with DDD.

In the past year, things have really gotten worse. I have developed severe fatigue, and my previously controlled insomnia is worse than ever. I was also diagnosed with anxiety/depression related to the deaths of several close family members. Despite being in and out of therapy and on meds, it (particularly the depression) just seems to be getting worse. I have developed several food sensitivities and GI problems where I never had any before. My skin is dry and itchy, and I have acne like I haven't had since 16. I also have frequent headaches, ranging from barely noticeable to debilitating. My joint pain has spread in the last few months from knees and hips to neck and shoulders, and now, basically every joint in my body hurts minus my right elbow. I have also developed intermittent numbness in my left hand in the past 2ish weeks.

I went to my ortho about my hips since they were the worst, and he diagnosed enthesitis and prescribed PT and meloxicam. I then found a PCP to start addressing the bigger issue. I'm lucky that she took my complaints so seriously. I know a lot of docs tend to brush this stuff off and just blame stress or weight, but she really listened. She asked a lot of questions and wanted to know about any recent blood work (normal except for high platelets; 458 as of 2 months ago). I had asked her about the possibility of Hashimoto's since both grandmothers have thyroid problems, and I've had quite a bit of weight gain recently. She said she could include it in the blood work, but she thought it sounded more like RA.

She ordered tests for a bunch of vitamin deficiencies and inflammatory markers, along with RF. I'm still waiting on the results, but in the meantime, I've been digging into RA. Lo and behold, I have essentially every classic symptom of it and generic autoimmune disease symptoms.

Obviously, I'm still going to wait on her diagnosis and recommendations, but I'm also slowly accepting that this might be it. If so, I'm grateful it was so simple, as I know that's not the case for most people. At the same time, I wanted it to be something fixable. There's that part of my brain that says I'm 22 I shouldn't be dealing with this. I went from being pretty active in college to being lucky to get a walk around the neighborhood.

Anyway, I'm rambling. Any advice for a not-quite-diagnosed young person?

EDIT: Thank you for all the helpful responses. I got the results of my labs back. I am ANA positive and CRP positive, so I am being referred to a rheumatologist. I was also deficient in vitamins D and B12, so my PCP recommended some supplements for the moment in hopes that it will improve my energy levels a little bit.",10,166k2ot,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/166k2ot/what_led_to_your_diagnosiswhat_was_your/,1693509182
What led to your diagnosis/what was your experience like?,comment,"any issue with your fingers?

edit: You could ask your doctor to check about ankylosing spondylitis too. Hips could be spine, neck is already involved and shoulders could be neck. Especially if you do not have finger involvement. If it is ra, it seems it progressed well enough and most likely there should be finger involvement at this point.",4,jykffak,,1693512139
What led to your diagnosis/what was your experience like?,comment,"I'm really sorry to hear that you've been having such a struggle physically and emotionally. Being in constant pain along with accompanying insomnia that makes everything worse is no fun at all. I know how you feel.

I'm very glad that your PCP took your concerns seriously. I've read too many stories about doctors dismissing patient complaints but especially for female patients being shown the door by male doctors. So, that's a real plus for you.

I've recently read that a significant part of joint damage from arthritis can occur in the early stages of the disease. I was diagnosed at five years of age in 1962 when very little effective medication was available, and so by the time I entered adolescence most of my joints were significantly damaged, which led to joint replacements down the line. So, the more quickly you can be diagnosed and begin taking medication, the better off you'll be. As you may or may not know, a great many effective medications are available today that can slow or halt the joint damage due to active arthritis. I strongly suspect but don't know that many people with arthritis take medication and go on to live quite well. We just don't see them here on Reddit, because they see no need to visit and post, ""I'm doing great!""

Since your depression, which is very common for those with chronic pain and illness, seems to be getting worse perhaps a medication change might be worth discussing with the doctor who prescribed your antidepressants. I think you're in a good place, though, with taking medication and having access to psychotherapy.

Give yourself some space to process the feelings you're having about your illness and pain and the inevitable uncertainty which anyone in your shoes would have. I hope you find some answers with your next doctor appointment, and please let us know how you're doing. ❤️

What led to your diagnosis/what was your experience like?,comment,"You are correct. You have some very ""inflammatory-y"" symptoms: plus allergies are your immune system getting angry at something environmental (including food allergies). RA is your immune system getting angry at yourself. Same goes for skin irritation! And there was a new study not long ago that found genetic markers for diseases like RA.
 I'm so sorry for the losses you're dealing with. 
Unfortunately, dealing with emotional pain and stress has legitimate effects on our physical health. It's not in your head. It's important to keep taking care of yourself and on healing. Sleep is when our bodies heal - everything from a little cut to your ACL. Not getting enough quality sleep is detrimental both physically and emotionally. During a difficult time in my life, I wasn't sleeping well at all. I began having wicked migraines, literally seeing things and slurring words. 
I'm so glad you have a physician who's listening to you. She definitely sounds like she will help you understand what's happening. That doesn't make it easy, though. I'm so glad you found us. We have a lot of great people your age, and we've all got your back 💜",3,jyks9bm,,1693516832

She also diagnosed me with EDS and Hashimoto’s.

What led to your diagnosis/what was your experience like?,comment,"Yes. They are one of the less painful aspects, but they definitely swell and get tender along with my wrists. It's the worst in the morning, and thankfully the swelling seems less severe now that it's not 100 degrees every day. I've also had a bit of weakness/tremor? Which sucks because I'm in my first year of pharmacy school, and it makes my compounding labs pretty difficult.

As for ankylosing spondylitis, it's definitely possible. I came across it while poking around for info about ra. However, I don't have one of the key markers for it, which is pain in the glutes and back of the thighs. All of my leg pain is localized to joints and occasionally radiates down the front or side of my leg, but almost never the back.

Still a good thing to think about, but I will be leaving that one to the experts. I'm a drug nerd, so this anatomy and physiology stuff is not really my forte 😅

What led to your diagnosis/what was your experience like?,comment,"Oh gosh, I can't imagine having symptoms so young. That's practically still a baby in my mind!

And yes, I know a good bit about the meds currently available. I've been working as a pharmacy technician for a couple of years and recently started pharmacy school (so I'll eventually learn even more about them). There have definitely been some major advances in the past several decades.

I plan on seeing my psychiatrist after I know a little more. Unfortunately, the process of switching antidepressants is annoyingly difficult. But if it is ra or another inflammatory problem, there is a lot of evidence that SNRIs can help lower inflammation and manage pain. They are just slightly less common than SSRIs.

Hi Im new here and I have a few questions.,post,"Im 43 (F) about sometime in May I began noticing pain, stiffness and swelling in my fingers, notably the 1st and 2nd set of knuckles and also in my feet and toes. Id wake up in the morning and be unable to close a fist for well over an hour. Getting out of bed to use the restroom was... interesting, clumsy and painful. Id get home from work just beyond exhausted. Id collapse on my couch, unable to move for the remainder of the day. Most days Id nod off from sheer exhaustion. At first I thought I had just over worked myself and that after my days off Id be better, but no. It went on this way for MONTHS. I finally went to my dr about 3 weeks ago and we did a bunch of bloodwork. My ANA can back positive, RF was a level 8, CCP was normal, sed rate normal... high leukocytes, low hemoglobin, high bilirubin. He gave me a referral to see a rheumatologist. My appt is set for December 20th, a very long wait to get seen. In the meantime my PCP gave me some meloxicam to help with swelling (which it did nothing for the swelling but I continued to take it). i even emailed my dr 2 days ago because my symptoms were getting worse and then, out of nowhere I wake up this morning and Im fine. I can close my fists, I can walk down my stairs, I went to work and had zero issues and the swelling that plagued my body for months and even the day before was seemingly gone. How? 

Is this normal for RA? Was I experiencing my first flare and then it just decided to settle down? And what will happen when I go see the rheumatologist in December? Will I look as though I am a fool or worse trying to make up an illness? Of course Im super happy my body is feeling better but will this affect how the doctor will be able to diagnose whatever is happening to me?",3,166si40,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/166si40/hi_im_new_here_and_i_have_a_few_questions/,1693529022

When I feel good I take advantage of it. I usually pay for it later bc I overdo it, but have also come to plan for that.

Let’s talk meds!,post,"Hi all!

I’m 35f. I was diagnosed in the summer of 2022. I first was prescribed hydroxychloroquine. I take it 5 days a week. It’s ok. I was still getting flare ups though so now I’m still on that but also taking sulfasalazine as well, 7 days a week. I’ve been doing both for about 3 months now. 

I’m still getting flare ups but i guess they aren’t as severe as they were when i wasn’t on medication at all. I just get so annoyed, like are these meds doing anything or ? 

Just curious to hear what you’re on.

My Rheumatologist says our next plan is to wait 3 more months, see if there’s any more progress then if not try certolizumab. I do know that’s a lot more pricey and it’s injections which I’m not very happy about. 

Wondering if anyone has any experience with these?

Oh I was also prescribed meloxicam for the pain… but I’ve only used it once or twice and didn’t notice anything???

I should also note I still like to enjoy alcohol on the weekends so I’m always weary/ trying to ensure whatever I take is still ok enough with that.

If you need a little hope…,post,"I know I’ve commented on several posts where others have expressed the same frustrations. I’ve been experiencing inflammatory arthritis for over a year now. My first rheumatologist was super hesitant to treat me with anything other than hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine, both which my body rejected. The whole time I was throwing up every day and in and out of the ER trying to take these meds my rheumatologist was not very responsive or helpful. He wouldn’t give me nausea meds nor any stronger nsaids to help with pain. He then told me to to stop meds and wait four months to see him again and if I got worse we would look at starting something else. I couldn’t wait another four months in pain so I found a second rheumatologist who listened to me and put me on methotrexate right away and even prescribed meloxicam for bad pain days. I went from basically bed ridden to baseline normal in two days. I’ve had 5 good days in a row this week and it’s only week one. It’s may take a while to find the right med but when you find yours - it’s magic. Also, if you feel stuck with your rheumatologist don’t be afraid to get a second opinion. I waited far to long to do so and I hurt myself by doing that. I wanted to share some good news and give some hope to those still searching for the magic combination.

If you need a little hope…,comment,"RA is an autoimmune disease. It is triggered by your immune system reacting to foreign substances which cause you to make autoantibodies which attack your own tissues.
The responsible immune system involved is that of your gut tissue.

Some people find that by keeping a careful log of everything they eat, drink, etc. each day and noting flare ups, good days, bad days, etc. you can often work out what that substance was. A journal is also useful to track meds and symptoms.

If you Google, you will find that many people have found grains to be such an antigen, e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, etc. I am one of those.

A big clue that food is involved is that your RA symptoms always improve when you fast (e.g. you are ill and can't eat much). Another is that your  symptoms change when on holiday and your diet has changed.


So 1. Keep a diary, 2. Try a grain free diet for 1 month.

With RA, everyone seems to be different. Some people have shown fantastic improvement by avoiding certain foods, some improve on a certain med while to others that med makes them even worse.

Only you know what affects you. Your doctor can only advise but it is you who are going through the pain and suffering. You need to research what an autoimmune disease is, log your details and work out what substances may be affecting you.

As an example celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that can be successfully treated by simply avoiding certain glutens. Most celiacs are sensitive to one particular gluten e.g. wheat gluten, rye gluten or barley gluten. But it has been found that about 20% react to a different substance (e.g. the gluten in oats). For those 20%, they have to work out what that substance is.

RA, celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases are all closely related, often symptoms overlap and doctors find it hard to distinguish between them because the spectrum of symptoms are so wide.
 
With my RA, if I avoid all grains then my symptoms improve dramatically but if I eat some gluten-free breads, I get a bad flare up the next morning. So I seem to be sensitive to something else in some breads , not just wheat.

I can eat rice (which is a grain and so does contain rice gluten) with no problems. I have not tested myself on other specific grains apart from wheat ( I made my own bread using only wheat flour with very bad results which was actually how I discovered all this stuff about grains and RA and that it was a 'thing'!).",2,ja22zdx,,1677394646
If you need a little hope…,comment,"It’s still blows my mind how differently everyone reacts to meds. I know sulfasalazine works for so many people but my body said no.

I definitely learned a lesson but I feel confident to advocate for myself now.",5,j9n4c7t,,1677124265
"Newly diagnosed, kind of?",post,"Hi everyone! i was faintly diagnosed with RA back in february after experiencing symptoms like swollen joints, joint pain, stiffness and sometimes my hands would slightly fall asleep if my elbows were bent for too long like driving or typing. after an appointment with my rheumatologist, she prescribed prednisone for 3 weeks as a trial run and even though it did start to help at the end of the trial, she was concerned with the fact that it made me sleepy when i would take it because it’s supposed to have the opposite effect? she brought up the possibility of fibromyalgia and the amount of research i’ve don’t of that doesn’t match the vast majority of my symptoms. but after that appointment she didn’t want to see me for another 8 months putting my next appointment in october. in between, i saw another rheumy for a 2nd opinion and all i got was gaslighting and a dr putting words in my mouth. i tend to shut down if i’m not listened to, do doing this has been really hard. (my husband is coming with me to my next one) the new rheumy brought fibromyalgia again and asked me about past trauma and that just doesn’t resonate with me and my consistent symptoms. my GP prescribed meloxicam and it’s been helping when i take it consistently so i’m a little confused if that’s helping me with my pain when i need it, would it not help fibromyalgia? has anyone been diagnosed with one or the other? my x-rays have also shown some arthritis in my knee and hips, i just feel like i’m not being heard. my fingers hurt, my wrists hurt, my knees, hips and spine are creaky and almost constantly stiff. can someone give me some input on this? im sorry this is so long!",3,169yr1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/169yr1j/newly_diagnosed_kind_of/,1693849833

I Adlai get a malar rash and hivez from the a sun so I think it's possible lupus a well.  But I am waiting to see what blood says again.

"Newly diagnosed, kind of?",comment,"Agree 💯 get another opinion and take someone with you. I have seronegative RA  (all my symptoms pointed to RA but RA negative in bloodwork, but inflammation marker positive) and fibromyalgia.  I had symmetrical joint pain (both hands, elbows, hips) and bad fatigue and brain fog. I also had discomfort very different than the joint pain, kind of like pins and needles pain in my forearms and lower legs. My Rheumatologist went by my symptoms and not just bloodwork. A course of prednisone took care of the joint pain but not the fibro pain. I started on treatment for both. Autoimmune diseases are very individual, and can be difficult to diagnose, so you need a good Rheumatologist who will listen to you and be willing to experiment a bit.

 i've had pain since i was like, 14 that was intense joint pain that caused me to need to quit the sport i had done pretty much all my life. based on the symptoms lining up precisely with mine, i began to advocate for myself since the pain had decreased the quality of my life and would inform my doctors and document symptoms due to my tests all showing negative. a few months ago i got the 14.3.3 eta protein test (positive) and was finally able to show it to my rheumatology clinic after being referred and never receiving a call back to schedule after leaving a voice mail a few times a week for about a year. 

i ended up getting scheduled and seen, and my xrays showed erosion in my finger! today was my follow up after being prescribed meloxicam for pain until the follow up where we review the results. at this appointment, i was diagnosed with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis today and prescribed plaquenil for treatment. now to begin this treatment journey!",21,143xzjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/143xzjh/okay_literally_biggest_update_ever/,1686194941

It’s extra bad around my periods and makes my degenerative disc disease miserable. Im taking meloxicam and naltrexone daily and the occasional meth-carb (can’t remember the full name on that muscle relaxer).

Sulfasalazine,post,"Curious on others’ experience with this medication… I have recently been diagnosed with seronegative RA and prescribed this as a start. 

I have experienced a wide range of strange side effects over the past two weeks. 

I actually took it for 9 days, stopped for 4.5 days because I was going on vacation out of the country and resumed it when I came home last night. Only had two doses and today ended up at the walk in clinic with strange back pain/numbness and elevated heart rate. 

I also got a minor sunburn on Thursday - the doctor thought that could be contributing to the heart rate. 

Other things I have experienced are chest pains (lasted two days), occasional headaches, a bit of a rash, a painful swollen lump on the back of my head, itchy bottoms of my feet, and now blood shot eyes. 

I don’t feel sick per se, and don’t have a fever. The doctor at the walk in didn’t seem too considered, just said to take Tylenol and Advil, and go to hospital if I have any shortness of breath or swelling around my mouth.

I am also on hydroxychloroquine which hasn’t been a problem at all for the 6 months I have been on it. Just wasn’t working well enough

UPDATE: I had a zoom appointment with my primary doctor and he gave me great info. He said that my reaction is very very common and to give it a month because most people adjust to it within a month. He also added Pantoprazole for 2 weeks and said to keep taking my famotidine. If after 2 weeks it isn’t enough he will keep me on the pantoprazole for a 2 month treatment and then back to famotidine only.

He said that pantoprazole interferes with calcium absorption so it can contribute to or worsen osteoporosis if you are on it long term. (I think year) My mom is and he basically said to have her check in with her doctor about her symptoms and options. He also said that sometimes we just have to choose the best option we have and GERD can lead to Barrett's esophagus which HAS to be treated because it can lead to esophageal cancer if it is left untreated. I’m so sorry some of you are dealing with that condition too. Keep taking good care of yourselves everyone!💕

And with RA my rheumatologist told me it HAS to be treated or it could eventually lead to organ damage etc. so yeah. I guess we all have to choose our best options. Even if our options are limited…

It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks to improve. If it doesn’t go away within a month, you might mention it to your doctor. Of course, if it gets worse, then I’d definitely mention it sooner.

Fat and protein are the most difficult for your body to break down so it needs a high acid amount in your stomach to do so. If you eat high fat and/or high protein first thing in the day, (fried eggs for example) your stomach will pump in a lot acid and keep it up for the day.

What do you know about sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)?,comment,"Thank you. I think because it can be such a debilitating disease that has flares, periods of remissions, and is so variable in severity for people , well meaning people attribute remission to things like diet to feel some sense of control for themselves. And others want to be helpful and hopeful for people they know and love. Because there aren’t studies on diet affecting it as well, you can’t prove it *doesn’t* work. But for me, because there aren’t studies and it can become debilitating and deadly even, it’s not worth putting my faith in something unproven over something that has been proven helpful. Even if the side effects of medication can be difficult to deal with. I am hopeful that this med combo (still taking hydroxychloroquine) will be easily tolerated after a few weeks and work long term so I don’t have to keep switching.

Biologics possibly failing/ maybe developing inflammatory bowel disease?,post,"Hi everyone! 

First time poster here so please bear with me. Has anyone ever experienced their biologics failing so soon after beginning them? For reference- I was initially diagnosed with potential psoriatic arthritis, and went for a second opinion which was later changed to seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. I started taking the Etanercept biosimilar (Erelzi) in April 2022. Prior to that I had no success with Methotrexate, plaquenil (very bad mental health while taking this with awful nightmares and ideation) and sulfasalazine with allergic reaction. Once I began the biologics I noticed a dramatic increase in my health and felt great, however it’s been a struggle to stay on them consistently due to constant infections. We were hit hard with Covid in July and I ended up hospitalized on supports, did the whole dosing schedule of Paxlovid etc. but obviously suffered immense setbacks during this time. Shortly after this I continued having upper respiratory infections which again necessitated stopping at the advice of my dr. I’m noticing since restarting the medicine that I just don’t feel …well, good at all? I was hoping as I approached that 3 month benchmark things would level out, but my energy levels continue to be ridiculously low, I have a lot of pain, swelling and redness, and I’m now suffering immensely in the bowel department. BM’s tend to be riddled with mucus and blood (SORRY 💩) and are never solid. I have lost around 42 lbs in under a year, and quite frankly I look half alive at this point. Has anyone ever experienced this? My mom had a history of psoriasis, and passed away from stage 4 colorectal cancer in her early 40s (I was 23 at the time) and my grandfather ended up developing crohns in his 70s and sadly passed in ICU after having surgery to remove the damaged bowel/colostomy bag.

You may want to check it out.  I can't imagine having to wait three years to see if you have UC. Is there anything your GP or Rheumatologist can do for you in the meantime?

You could have long covid. They know so little about it that some symptoms aren't documented. For example, they are just starting to say that covid causes hair loss. I'm almost bald now because of it. I lived with bloody loose stools for many years before my UC diagnosis. It all takes time to find the perfect treatment, and having covid is a horrible setback.

Methotrexate gives me little ulcers in my mouth or at the side of my lips from time to time. The main bitch of a side effect (though possibly also related to catching covid a while ago?) is that I get sick often and recover veeeeery slow. Always had a bit of a weak immune system so this stuff just made it worse. A light cold can take a week to pass over. The flu might take up 2-3 weeks. I end up having to skip my methotrexate for a week to make it go away fastee but it doesn't do miracles.

The anti-inflammatory stuff gives me stomach trouble but as long as I take em after food they are fine and I was given some supplements that help too.",5,k3gisfd,,1696441723

I stopped taking Sulfasalazine (500mg 4x daily) because I thought it was causing mood swings and depression.

The pain almost immediately came back. It took over a month for it to work and I didn’t even realize because it was so slow. The next day I started getting achy again. Mood swings and depression still here but I’m going to stop for a week under Rheumatologist’s advice and see. 

I had my doctor order xrays for my hands and it came back completely normal. No joint or bone abnormalities. I’ve had the RA blood factor twice, both negative. Sedimentation factor negative (twice). Thyroid T4 and TSH normal. ANA screen neg, CCP neg… I don’t know what to do. It seems like there’s nothing left to test for. The only abnormal things are my kidney and liver. I have no actual problems, they just show up on the edge of normal, like 1 unit below the normal range for ALT or 0.02g/dL away from “abnormal” Albumin/globulin levels. I asked my doctor about it and he said it was all normal or nothing to worry about.

As for those labs, they are all subjective. If your rheum doctor isn't worried, then you shouldn't be either.

Which Med Do I Choose?,comment,"Currently on Plaquenil and Orencia, but did take MTX and sulfasalazine previously. I don’t drink because it makes my symptoms worse, and I didn’t really drink much prior to being diagnosed. MTX didn’t work on me and made me super tired. The sulfasalazine worked okay, but not great so the doc added Plaquenil. He decided to keep upping the dose of sulfasalazine, and I was starting to experience some odd neurological issues, and my mental health started to spiral. I had to stop taking it completely. The Plaquenil has worked well, but the doc felt I needed more because my inflammation markers were still to high, and I was still experiencing pain and stiffness. Everyone is different in how they’ll react to the meds, though, so it can be kind of a crap shoot. If alcohol is a consideration, that might help you with your decision. I can tell you that I’ve suffered from terrible IBS from a young age, and the sulfasalazine helped with that for a long time. It was nice to have some relief.",1,jrftdhc,,1689015917

It never bothered my labs/organs. I lost a ton of hair on metho and it didn’t help. Tried Arava and Imuran and they didn’t work. Started having a rash on plaquenil, just stopped it.

Which Med Do I Choose?,comment,"I was given options and information and allowed to have input on what I started with -- between methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and plaquenil. I appreciated it.

I chose MTX because it starts working faster than plaquenil. It didn't work for me and had too many side effects to up the dose, so I was switched to leflunomide and humira. But, I could have skipped MTX if I wanted to have kids, for example, or if I wanted to be able to drink (totally get that you don't want to lose more stuff to the RA).

My partner's doctor didn't offer options and just started them on plaquenil right away, which has been working on its own for a while now. (If plaquenil works, it seems pretty good because you don't need constant bloodwork, just a yearly eye check. I feel like a pincushion, especially now that I'm doing humira on top of the bloodwork lol)

MTX gave me constant nausea and made me feel absolutely wiped out for 2 days after taking it. Plaquenil doesn't seem to give my partner any side effects, except maybe some stomach upset if they forget to take it with food. It can take up to 6 months to fully kick in, though.

When enough of it builds in your system (by like day 4-7) of your taper, you will wake up at 3 AM with your heart pounding, etc. I’d recommend just get up for an hour. Get distracted.

Can’t afford shit,comment,"Sounds like you're in the US. The healthcare system is so fucking infuriating and inhumane. No one should have to go without maintenance medication. Ever.

Especially when it comes to chronic illness, tying your access to medication so heavily to your income, which is dependent on your ability to work, to be productive and active, is a cruel joke. The sicker you get, the harder it is to afford the medication you need to get better. It's such a perverse and vicious cycle.

And not to mention the ideology of American rugged individualism dictates that not only are you supposed to pull yourselves up by your own bootstraps, you're supposed to do so while your joints are crumbling and your body is screaming in pain. Not happy about it? Well, you're lazy and a dirty communist if you want socialized healthcare.

I hope the US wakes up one day and switches over to some form of single payer or universal healthcare but the outlook still looks bleak. 

I'm very lucky that I moved to Taiwan after college, and we have excellent universal healthcare here. I only developed arthritis a few years ago, and had planned to live here permanently, but now I cannot imagine moving back and having to worry about medical expenses like that. 

I know it's not an option for everyone but I highly recommend moving to a country (like Taiwan) that has universal healthcare if you can. The initial cost to uproot and move might seem high but over the long term, the peace of mind is priceless.

I had my knees drained 2 weeks ago and shots were also given. I feel great cos i can stand up straight and walk now in the mornings! But my wrists are stubborn af. Been having the sausage finger since. Swelling and pain goes down a bit with prednisone but does not completely eliminate it.

Was wondering what your experience is? Especially with people whose hands are affected. It sucks! I can barely do any task without pain. :( hope to hear some positive stories.

I can also chop veggies, garden, and recently painted the fireplace and surround with a small brush. I’m also having no trouble dressing or picking up my water bottle. These things were all difficult to impossible for me before Orencia kicked in. Don’t think my hands last as long, and I still need help opening some things, but overall they are amazingly better. And my wedding rings are so loose they spin around annoyingly. Crazy.",2,k2f8bh2,,1695818251
Will i have my hands back?,comment,"I don't have my hands back fully, but they are definitely improving. I started with mtx early this year, then was switched to lefluonomide, then humira was added to that a couple months ago. It's definitely helping. I still can't do everything I used to do (my thumbs cause me the most trouble), but it's better than it was. My knees aren't as bad, either. I was having days where stairs were really hard, and I haven't had that in months. 

It's hard, because the meds all take a while to kick in, and sometimes the improvement is so incremental it's hard to track on a shorter scale. (And while I'm happy to be on a biologic because I think it's the thing that's finally tipping the scale, dealing with all of the insurance and savings cards and copay assistance is a monthly headache... and I'm dreading changing insurance, but it's going to happen soon.)",2,k2ffi9a,,1695821392
Will i have my hands back?,comment,I promise you that it does start to feel better. I think it took me about 6 months before I started to feel normal again.

Will i have my hands back?,comment,"I have significant hand/wrist involvement, plus tfcc tears on both sides and tenosynovitis and some other stuff. I have SO much going on in my wrists and hands, both arthritis and injury-related, and they are really bad. But I also work with my hands and need to be able to make fine movements. I also have PsA. When my meds are working, I’m great. Worst case is some stiffness, a smidge of pain, but then once I get going, I’m totally fine. When my meds are not working, or like right now, I’m flaring while transitioning from one biologic to another, I’m a wreck. I need steroid injections more frequently, and short-course oral steroids. My work is impacted, but with the steroids, it’s not terrible. So for me, absolute worst case is flare with an increase in stiffness/pain, decrease in range of motion, but I take steroids and am still able to function. It’s not terrible, and flares of this severity don’t happen that often for me. I think this is my third *really bad* flare in the last 8 years. My not-a-doctor opinion is the stuff that’s most debilitating/prohibitive is the permanent damage to the joints and surrounding areas. All the other stuff like swelling, stiffness, all the ‘itis-es, etc., are all helped tremendously by oral steroids as needed.  As long as you’re being treated aggressively, the goal/hope is that permanent damage will not occur, and you’ll never get to that point of complete loss of functioning. And it sounds like your rheum is being pretty aggressive. You can also ask for steroid injections in the wrists; these help me SO much. Hopefully you get to a good med combo and everything settles down for a long time!",2,k2g8zl0,,1695832222

Today, my hands are so swollen I can’t use them. It’s been three years and my hands are not anywhere close to what they were before my diagnosis.   For me, I’m finding if I eat gluten, it seems to be a source of inflammation and it sets things off.

But she said when the inflammation gets under control, it will be less painful. So I guess the whole moral of it about your hands going back to the way they were, is how much damage was done, Andy in my case, a lot of damage. But hopefully other joints won’t get damaged. Also, I think you just learn to work with it. You know what’s painful and what’s not and you just modify everything as people in this thread have already said.

I was diagnosed last November and I don't remember exactly when I started to feel like my old self but it's been a while. It felt like it took forever to get to where it is now. What you're experiencing is normal. It will take some time ❤️ this group is a great place to ask questions and get the support you need. You are not alone. Be gentle with yourself. And talk to your rheumatologist if you haven't seen any improvement at all, they will likely increase the dose. Mine went from 3 tabs to 5 then to 6 now I'm down to 4 because the inflammation is going down. It's steady improvement.

Will i have my hands back?,comment,"3 years ago, before I got my diagnosis, I was very much into yoga. I’ve been doing it since 1977.  I still can’t do a downward dog or the sun salutation sequence.  At least I can’t do it the way I used to.  I do a modified version of it now.  I only do what I can do and I listen to my body.  

I found some chair yoga videos on YouTube.  

When my hands are in a flare, I avoid doing anything that hurts.  So the yoga I do today is nowhere near the yoga I was doing before I was diagnosed.  But something is better than nothing.


I figure I’m in constant pain whether I’m sitting or sleeping or standing or moving around. So I may as well move. It all hurts. It all hurts a lot.   So I might as well do something that’s healing.  I might as well move.  That hurts just as much as everything else.  But it’s better than just sitting.

Plus, I’ve noticed if I do gentle stretching yoga in the morning, I’m able to move much better throughout the day. I notice a difference if I skip it.

That’s been my experience. 

Maybe find some movement you enjoy. Just know you’ll need to modify & listen to you body (like you have a choice, right??)

🤍



The other thing I do when my hands are in a flare, I don’t do any typing or any texting.  I use the voice activated thingy. It makes frequent mistakes, but it’s again better than nothing.",1,k2kxgvu,,1695911298

Did anyone else have to do 3 medications and the same time 3 months to get approved for biologics?,comment,"In Aus, with the government subsidising medication through the PBS, we have to have the rheumy apply for funding of a biologic, with criteria of having done 3 months (can't remember, maybe 4?) of the more common treatments without improvement, as well as inflammation of a certain number of major or minor joints.    
The easy explanation is that they cost so much more but PBS rules are designed by doctors so maybe there's a bit of 'try a traditional treatment with known side effects first before hitting it with the new big guns.' They also have a rule about only getting 3 attempts with different biologics if they prove ineffective.   
Sounds like your insurance has similar rules.   
Certainly when I was diagnosed it was all about methotrexate being the wonder drug, with proven efficacy over decades. It just wasn't cutting it for me so they ended up adding hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide, with prednisone all through those 6 months, before going to adalimumab (which was an immediate game changer: just looking at reducing the others slowly now, hoping to drop them.  )  
They kept saying that mtx etc take a few months to kick in sometimes so I was putting in the time waiting (but certainly got very frustrated in the absence of improvement. )

For example, you could contract a virus, pass it on to a family member that develops symptoms and then you could develop symptoms after them. This means that you can't point fingers and blame family members for making you sick. Considering you will potentially be visiting medical facilities for pharmaceuticals and doctors as well as mixing with classmates, you potentially pose one of the highest risks of contracting and spreading illnesses within your household.

I wouldn't recommend blaming your family and causing unnecessary tension considering it can't be proved and you feel guilty for it.

Starting methotrexate next week,comment,"I, and many others on this subReddit are or have been on methotrexate for years and have found it to be effective with minimal side effects. Methotrexate can cause nausea after taking it, and taking it in the evening before bed can be helpful. Also make sure your doctor discusses taking a folic acid supplement with you. Everyone's experience is different, if you have bothersome side effects let your doctor know, there are other medications to try. Methotrexate is usually the first one on the list that doctors prescribe, insurance expects it as it is one of the oldest, least expensive effective meds. I was on it for several years and it worked well for me, it became less effective as time went on so I was switched to biologics.

So my Dr switched me to the injection and told me to double up on my Levomefolic acid(folic acid).

Pyralin (Sulfasalazine) side effects,comment,"Just to clarify, are you experiencing those side-effects or are you concerned about the possibility of experiencing them?

In the case of the first, call your doctor. Those are serious and probably indicates you aren't well-suited to the medication. There are alternatives.

In the case of the latter, I can only reassure you from my own experience. I've been on sulfasalazine (salazopyrin) for almost 3 years and it's one of the few medications I don't hate. In comparison to other medications I'm trying, it's pretty amazing. I don't have any notable side effects from it and find that it works pretty well (not quite well enough but it does it's best). It's one of the few medications that aren't making me nauseated. 

If you're really concerned about the si effects, which is valid, talk to your doctor about waiting a few weeks to start the new meds. It takes a few months to start working properly anyway so you probably aren't going to notice much of an immediate benefit while the side effects can start from day 1.

Biologic fears,post,"Hello, all!

I've been in need of a biologic for like 5 years, as I'm considered severe even with injected mtx and several tries with plaquenil and sulfasalazine. 

I have a very high family history of heart disease in my family. Intensely high. Cancer also runs heavy as well.

They want me on Actemra. I am just quite scared to go on any of them, because of the side effects. I've been putting it off for all these years and still come to the same conclusion.

My rheumy doesn't recommend Xeljanz because it doesn't have a long enough track record on the books. I really don't want to do infusions. My panic disorder has the same symptoms as an allergic reaction and I think sitting overthinking would cause me to spike. So I'd want an auto injector or a pill.
I also have some organ involvement so the pill/meds also worry me there with filtering it.

I know everyone reacts differently. That either way, the potential for a shorter life span is likely.

I think even with anxiety and thinking about the worst case scenario, it’s hard to not take solace in the fact that you are in exactly the right place of an emergency we’re to occur. A whole team of trained professionals at a moments notice. And once you’re all out there is practically no risk of anything drastic occurring. 

I was on remicade for several years and the worst thing that happened was sometimes the IV would be itchy, I tell the nurse, she slows the infusion down, itching goes away. Also liked that the nurses could do blood work and IV in one poke! 

Embrel: Self injections created a lot of anxiety for me. These days I think they improved the formula so it doesn’t sting as much anymore. When I was on them it stung so bad and I had to hold it for at least 10 seconds on my leg. Awful. I kept skipping dieses and after a panic attack I told my rheumatologist I can’t do this anymore. Medication did work though, but bad fit for me. 

Xeljanz: It is a newer medication and the long term effects aren’t as well known as the other medications. I have been on it for 7 years and love it, but I get the risks and that not everyone is comfortable with them. The once a day pill medications are the least hassle with the same potency as the other medications. 

Side effect lists for medications: most side effects are not likely, in studies any time the participants have anything that could be side effect it has to be reported. So most lists are long and scary but the majority of the side effects are likely not caused by the medication itself. For many medications there are probably 2-3 key risks that are actually worthy of concern, and a doctor can help walk you through those risks in relation to your medical history. But if they want you to take a medication they are recommending it because they thing the risks outweigh the benefits, otherwise they wouldn’t make the recommendation at all.",9,jf38t3v,,1680722138
Biologic fears,comment,"I’m currently on Actemra. Side effects have been minimal. Sometimes I feel a little hot. That’s all. Been on it 18 months. It’s worked really well. I take it as an auto-injector every other week. No infusion. 

I’ve also been on Humira and Enbrel in the past. Was briefly on xeljanz but it raised my liver levels so the doctor told me to stop it. 

I’ve been on methotrexate in the past, and frankly that one gave me the worst side effects. Nausea for two days each week I took it. Felt horrible. I feel like it’s side effects are worse than the biologics. 

Humira gave me some weird nerve sensations. I was fine on it bi-weekly, but then had to up to once a week and had some weird sensations on the side of my head. 

I would also recommend you try to be as healthy as possible, just to limit the chances of things like heart disease/cancer. Also try to exercise if you can. I love bikram yoga and it helps with RA too. Good luck with what you decide to do",3,jf3cs1w,,1680723620

Biologic fears,comment,"I can understand your hesitation over side effects, particularly with your family history. But for me, I was more concerned with treating the RA and the pain and inflammation (which would likely reduce your chances for heart disease). I tried quite a few biologics (either infusions or auto-injectors) which either didn't help or stopped helping after a while. I tried Xeljanz but it did nothing for me. As soon as I started Actemra, my inflammatory markers came down immediately (I take 1 pre-filled syringe a week). I felt significantly better, although I still have pain. I have had no side effects from this medication. If your RA is severe and your doctor is recommending a biologic, I would strongly consider that.

Biologic fears,comment,"Hold up - your rheumy is saying Xeljanz doesn't have a long enough track record? It was approved back in 2012. 

My thought is  - How are you being treated for your panic disorder? Stress is likely complicating your RA horribly. 

As RA patients, we already have higher than normal cancer rates - double in fact. Which means, without treatment we are looking at some very horrifying statistics. This increased risk is from unchecked inflammation. 

The overall cancer risk for patients on biologics was less than 4% (averaged). When compared to DMARD, there was no increased risk. 

Compare each drug's increased risk for cancer vs the placebo group and you often find there is NO increased risk at all, given the already higher than average RA/cancer comorbidity risk when adjusted for treatment.",1,jf3pc6e,,1680728305

How did your RA start?,post,"I understand everyone has different progression but I just wanted to know if my experience resonated with yours here.

Blood test: My RA factor has increased from below 5 to 10 in the last two years. Anti CCP from 0.5 to 3.5. Esr and CRP show marginal increases. 

Pain: hand pain started in 2017. Stiffness and pain lasting a few week but went away on its own. Four weeks back, pain started in my left elbow and has since spread to both hands and elbows. In the hands, the knuckles and the joint directly above it hurts more. Stiffness, swelling that gets better with some activity. The pain switches in intensity from one arm to the other every few days, so not constant pain in a joint. Too much activity makes things worse. Have one bad knee from flat foot and over pronation, but now have pain and instability in my other knee as well. Swelling and pain in ankle comes and goes. Same with toes. (All this started 8 weeks after I got terrible pain and swelling in my bad knee)

Other symptoms: I have dry eyes, throat and mouth. I get swelling in my eyes from time to time. I am always drinking water every 15 mins but am still thirsty. 

Family History: sister has Raynauds. She has pain and swelling in hands and is trying to get a diagnosis. Mom has had arthritis treated with Steroids and Sulfasalazine. No one has told her what kind of arthritis she has. She is on heavy pain killers and says staying active is better than resting for her pain. 

I have a PCP appt this week. Hoping to get referral to Rheumat. Am worried as I am hoping to be pregnant soon through IVF and am concerned what impact this could have. Should I ask my PCP to get X-Rays and MRI, and maybe ultrasounds done while I wait for rheumatologist appt? Should I ask him for medicines like steroids- I am concerned my symptoms will subside and I won’t get a diagnosis. 

Thank you!

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences. You’ve made me feel heard, that my pain is real and I need to find a solution. I will update once I have a diagnosis.",5,14ek1kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/14ek1kd/how_did_your_ra_start/,1687288180
How did your RA start?,comment,"Mine came on overnight. I was perfectly fine one day and the next morning I couldn't bend or move any of my fingers for close to 3 hours. Within a few months my wrists had sharp pain and I had trouble doing most things like pulling, lifting and writing. I'm seronegative so my blood work is all clean including inflammatory markers but I have visible swelling in my MCP and PIP joints. I was diagnosed because my x-rays came back with juxta articular osteopenia in my MCP and PIP joints bilaterally and my ultrasound/MRI showed moderate synovitis with some scarring. It's now in my feet and knees but still worse in my hands. If I take a 40 min nap I can't bend my fingers at all again until they warm up for a couple hours. The stiffness and pain sets in extremely fast. Lots of sharp pain and burning pain in some of the PIP joints.

Some of your symptoms sound like sjrogens syndrome so you might want to read up on that too 🙂. Best of luck to you and I hope you feel better and get the treatment you need.

How did your RA start?,comment,"For years I’d had joint pain off and on in various joints. Sometimes only lasting a day or two. Knees would swell a bit and get stiff but only for a few days. Same with an ankle. Hip flared up for a couple of months — diagnosed with bursitis. Shoulder flared up for a few months — couldn’t lift it to my chest level for about six months. (It was right at start of Covid so I couldn’t do PT.) Fingers would get sore but I assumed it was OA. Couldn’t walk well at all if I sat for an hour or so (noticed most on car trips or late evening on couch.) Mornings I couldn’t walk down stairs normally until I’d been up for 30-60 minutes. 

Went to PCP for something unrelated.  He noticed my MCPs were swollen — lots of both soft tissue and joint swelling. Casually mentioned my pointer MCP was getting sore off and on and would look pinkish. He made referral to rheumatologist that day saying “you know you have a high probability of inflammatory arthritis.” I was basically 🤷🏻‍♀️. Have history of lots of weird rashes, hives, dermatographia. Have siblings with MS, Crohn’s, and some type of vasculitis. Per PCP, my “immune system likes to get revved up.”

Saw rheum about four months later. Diagnosed on first visit. Started prednisone, had a blood work and x-rays, then started methotrexate ten days later after the prednisone made a crazy difference in pain, swelling, and stiffness.

How did your RA start?,comment,"I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's in 2010 which has mostly been controlled with levothyroxine, although last year I started getting bad lower back pain and tiredness which I put down to a combo of Hashi's and perimenopause. First couple of months this year, I felt a lot better then I had a bad flare of tendinitis in my right hand mid-March, which then went to my left hand, then shoulder etc. I had been doing a lot of knitting and just assumed it was overuse, so I slowed things down a bit. Then I caught Covid for the first time at the end of March. Two weeks later my knees started aching like I'd run a marathon the previous day, and my hand pain started up again. Then shoulder, then ankles, then the bottom of my feet like I'd been walking on gravel. It was getting to be too much so I saw my GP/PCP at the end of May - they thought it might be post-viral inflammatory arthritis and referred me for blood tests. RF were 396, Anti-CCP was >196, so the provisional diagnosis is probably RA and I've been referred to a rheumatologist but haven't heard anything back yet. Had x-rays which which came back as no bone or joint damage, so I'll probably be in the queue for a while. In the meantime, I'm managing with a combo of slow-release ibuprofen and diclofenac but my mobility is pretty bad. I'm really hoping I get to see the rheum soon and can start on steroids, as it sounds like it's made such a difference to a lot of people!

My father has psoriasis and gout, my mother has osteoarthritis and Dupuytren's contracture, which my brother has also inherited - no sign of it in my hands yet, though I have a lot of nodes, swelling, and stiffness in them at the moment.

As I got older I became an EMT and I believed I was feeling pain and swelling and stiffness just do to the physical nature of my job. My hands were the first to go at 26, bilateral carpal tunnel frozen stiff and super painful, but again I thought nothing of it because I had a physical job. Fast forward a year at age 27 I’m working 911 and worked all of COVID. I experienced so much stress from the high call volumes, seeing people passing away, having two young kids and then lost my father on his birthday at only 49 years old from COVID. Then I moved out of state because of that and left my career so as a family we could start fresh. As soon as we moved i got COVID myself and my first and only symptom was extreme lower back pain to the point where I was on the floor. I started having worse hand problems, then my shoulders went ( I couldn’t even lift my arms) they felt frozen and the pain was unbearable. All tests / X-rays came back normal so they kept telling me it could be stress, ptsd or anxiety related. Then it went to my feet, then knees and before you know I lost the mobility to walk. I experienced this all when I got COVID. I fought to see a rheumatologist and they said I was too young to have RA. We’ll I finally got them to agree for the blood work and my levels were crazy. It was all red. IGA was 7, IGG was 12, IGM was >100 and CCP was >250. At 27 I felt like my life was over they started me on MTX and I took prednisone for 5 months straight with no improvement, then went to taking Enbrel injections for another 5/6 months with no improvement and finally got put on Rinvoq which gave me my life back and I am 29 now. It took a year to figure out medications to aggressively work to help me gain my mobility back. Fight for the bloodwork to be done I believe it’s the ANA. I know during pregnancy or trying to conceive they ask you and will NOT put you on these meds if you’re trying or are pregnant. Rheumatologists are great. We’ll most of them lol. Because I already had kids I was open to all treatments and had to sign a paper when I did the methotrexate because it’s like low dose chemo.

"Hi, anyone tried biologics? Side effects?",post,"28F,experienced symptom Aug 2021. Entire 2022 wrong diagnosis by Oncologist. Jan this year only realised maybe it's RA. Diagnosed with >1000 anti ccp, RF. Confirmed as RA. Currently on mtx(recently increased to 7 pills weekly), plaquenil once daily and sulfasalazine 4 daily. Stopped prednisolone as i took it for 5 months over. Despite the increase in med, my readings are around 50-60, which the normal range is below 40. Doc said the medication will not help further and need to consider biologics. 
1) biologic is very expensive for me. 
2) doc said even with injection, may not be able to push my RA into remission as it may not be the correct suppression immunity route
3) risk on other infections eg TB because the biologic will suppress my immunity 
I've some side effects like drastic hairfall even with oral med thus far esp after increment of 7 mtx instead of 6. My eye checkup wasn't really well and ophthalmologist need to monitor every half year😕 
Felt really hopeless. It's like knowing the side effects the meds give me,taking them, and not showing any sign of remission. I could no longer lead a normal active lifestyle. Playing games/ typing on keyboards itself hurts.
Just wondering if anyone experienced the same and somehow got a bit better/more manageable and how long did it take? 
Also, if anyone is taking biologics and if it actually helps more than oral med? Did you feel worse after taking biologics? Or any tips on taking extra precautions etc once I started biologics?

Regarding the cost, Abbvie (Humira manufacturer) has both a copay assistance and a rebate program; I believe both reduce your payment to about $5/mo.

ETA: this is only anecdotal, but I have been less susceptible to catching illness of those around me after switching to Humira. I got a cold or two on MTX and it took ages to get over.",3,jtt9z21,,1690556897
"Hi, anyone tried biologics? Side effects?",comment,"Does your Rheumatologist know about your eye issues? If not, you need to let them know asap. Plaquenil can cause issues to the retina.  Your Rheumatologist will know best whether or not there's a connection with the plaquenil. As far as biologics go, I have been on Enbrel, Humira, and now Rinvoq.  Enbrel and Humira worked well for me for awhile, then stopped working. I have been on Rinvoq now for about two years and it is working really well. I haven't had any bad side effects from the biologics, maybe a little stomach upset now and again. No issues with infections either.

I have other symptoms that align with EDS and symptoms that align with other chronic illnesses, but whatever chronic illness I have, the meds I take ease my symptoms so I take them.

EDIT: not to be disheartening, it took about 7 years to find the correct meds for me. I had severe reactions to a lot of meds. During my early teens I was taking 40 pills a day and weekly infusions.

If Everyone Can Handle Another Methotrexate Question...,post,"I did a search, but didn't find quite what I was looking for. Anyway, my doc started me on Methotrexate injections in January. I've been on Plaquenil for almost two years and Sulfasalazine for about a year with just minor relief. 

So, I was very hopeful that Methotrexate would be a miracle drug for me. After 8 weeks, I went back in for blood work and reported no change in symptoms. Thankfully, I've also had ZERO side effects from any of the meds. The PA informed me that my dosage (.4ml) was under the minimum medically effective dose and increased me to .6. I just felt so defeated. Two months wasted on a dose that was never going to work! And I understand that it takes months to become effective. So, I've been on the .6 ml dosage for 6 weeks or so (I'd have to go back to my calendar to get exact dates). No side effects, but also no change in symptoms. In fact, my right knee and right foot have gotten worse since then. 😔 I'm just so sad. We have a big trip coming up in about 8 weeks and when I started on methotrexate, I was SO hopeful that I'd be nearly pain-free by then. Here we are, nearly four months later and nothing. 

At what point do I concede that it has failed? Am I just not giving it enough time? Do I need a higher dose? I'm a small person, if that matters...5' tall and I bounce between 115 and 120 lbs.

She wanted me to try tapering off it after a month too, but then I told her that the Enbrel still didn’t feel like it kicked it yet. It takes at least 3 months for any RA medication to work so I stayed on prednisone and didn’t taper until after 3 months from it.

RA and PMLE,comment,"Hello! First, please ask your prescriber about taking meds together or stopping them. We're not physicians, and even if someone identifies themselves as a physician it's not ok for them to give medical advice on Reddit. We want everyone safe and healthy 💜
I don't think we've had a post about PMLE. I wonder if that's why there hasn't been a reply. But we have had several discussions about photosensitivity! According to the [Mayo Clinic ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polymorphous-light-eruption/symptoms-causes/syc-20355868)
PMLE (Polymorphous Light Eruption) is a rash caused by sun exposure. Mine is caused by Plaquinel, which is a different type of med than sulfasalazine, but they have a lot of the same side effects, including skin rash resulting from sun exposure. I have changed my behavior to avoid exposure, and now have a lovely selection of wide-brimmed hats, and clothes with built in sunblock. I know for certain there are lots of people here who have the same sensitivity. You can look back through older posts. It might be a good idea to edit your post to include ""photosensitivity"", because that's the term we've been using. I'm so glad you found us! Having lived with PLME for so long must be frustrating. I hope we can share some ideas that may help! If not, we're an  excellent place to have a good rant if you need one. Take care 💜",1,jy974z2,,1693329119
RA and PMLE,comment,"I try to tell everyone, just in case! I've only had it since I began taking Plaquinel, and it's more frustrating than I would have imagined. I wonder if the treatments for RA will help? So many of us have additional autoimmune dxs (comorbidities). If you don't mind me asking, how long did you have RA symptoms before getting your dx? I wonder if the PMLE dx masked your RA, and maybe you've had RA for a while. I hope it was a great holiday 😊",1,jy9iidl,,1693333215

I found it too annoying. 

What is strange is that after two-three years I stopped doing the booth and the rash stopped appearing. I’m not sure if that was expected or if maybe it wasn’t what they thought.

RA and PMLE,comment,"Did they tell you that you have cero-negative RA? You're totally right about ""proper"" symptoms, but after a few years on here I believe there's no such thing. Plus, you may be compensating for your ankle pain in such a way that makes your back sore. It's a natural thing - we don't even realize we're doing it. 
Also interested in your experience with NHS vs private. I'm in the US, but we have people who are struggling with getting a dx through NHS, so they're asking for advice about going to a private practitioner. 
Whoever you work with, just make sure they're aware of your natural remedies just to be safe. Steroids and other meds are not appealing, but RA can do some brutal damage that will reduce the quality and even the duration of your life. Here's a page from [John's Hopkins ](https://www.hopkinsarthritis.org/arthritis-info/rheumatoid-arthritis/) about the risks of unmanaged RA. I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know, but I understand how conflicted a person can be about things like this. Take care of yourself!!

21f struggling with arthitis,post,"Hi all. I’m a 21f and was diagnosed with RA last spring. I think it is safe to assume it was triggered by getting Covid or the vaccine. My first few months I genuinely thought I was dying, couldn’t leave bed, couldn’t lift myself out of bed, couldn’t walk, couldn’t open my closet, etc. I had to quit working and fell behind in school because I was so depressed and scared (and in 10/10 pain every single day). Started in my feet and spread fast to my wrists, fingers, and knees. No one knew what was wrong with me for a long time. It wasn’t until late summer I began taking sulindac and sulfasalazine for relief as well as some pain killers. Luckily my sharp pains are all controlled now. Does anyone know if this is because my medicine has covered it up and it is still present, or does this medication control it so much, that my body isn’t in pain, even though it’s covered up. Ive recently noticed if i accidentally skip a day, my sharp pains don’t return. I’m curious if my pain is still present and I just am unaware because of my medication. Or is it possible my pain is gone for now? I’ve recently been struggling with soar knees and weak knees and joints. It’s safe for me to assume that if I’m active the entire day I will be in pain later. I’ve also been struggling because no one knows the severity of my illness, not even my own parents. My bosses don’t understand, my friends are so comforting but I know they don’t understand, it has just been an overall very isolating and overwhelming diagnosis and experience. I also had a very sick dad and was very stressed and constantly anxious about that. I’ve read In this thread that RA Can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or a negative childhood (I have many negative childhood experiences). I guess the point of this post is to share my experience with others, as well as ask if anyone on these medications can share their experiences with me. The work I do is physical labor and thinking about my future with my illness terrifies me. It’s a lonely fight and I am seriously thinking about everyone who fights this illness with empathy and love.",12,14xbqwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/14xbqwe/21f_struggling_with_arthitis/,1689130115
21f struggling with arthitis,comment,"So I’m 26, diagnosed at 24. The vaccine didn’t cause my RA, but it definitely woke it up. I would’ve had RA anyway, but the vaccine triggered such a large immune response that if then triggered my first flare so I get that and it completely sucks. It’s especially hard when you’re young. Know that it’s okay to grieve the body you thought you had if it helps accept your diagnosis. It’s okay to be sad and mad and frustrated. Let yourself feel those things. Just try to not live in that headspace for too long. With RA you can have flares when pain is really bad, you’re more swollen, your RF is high, etc. You can also go into periods of remission when your RA is controlled and you have little to no symptoms. Unfortunately you may swing back and forth between these throughout life. I will say this, medicine can definitely help and has come a long way. Some of the side effects suck though so be on the lookout for that. It can be a lonely road. For me I also worry about the future and how mine will look when having this condition. I think that’s a completely normal worry to have and is just part of being human.

21f struggling with arthitis,comment,"Diagnosed at 37, dealing with it since I was 34, though I think my first actual flair happened when I was 31. I was very sick with the strangest “flu,” but my symptoms were high fever and severe joint pain. I wasn’t able to dress, go to the bathroom or even move without a ton of pain. Doctors never did diagnose anything for sure, and I was supposed to see a rheumatologist but never did until I started having regular pain in my hands and feet.

I’m 43 now, been on a good number of meds and have a good amount of experience with this. I was on sulfasalazine for a long time along with Plaquenil. I started to have some negative side effects that were affecting my daily life so I’m now on Orencia and Plaquenil. Still take NSAIDS and Tylenol from time to time, but stress absolutely makes me flare up. I found a different job that’s less stressful which has helped. Staying active is important, but you’ll have to go east on yourself - walking, water aerobics, anything low impact is good. Know when to rest and do it. Drink lots of water and consider changing your diet. If you can get an office job of some kind, especially one where you can work from home, that’s the ideal way to go IMO.

Nauseas with meds - Help?,post,"I'm 48 yrs old, female, dx with RA in March 2023.

BUT, my son and husband just got over covid (I didn't get it this time - thanks vaccines) AND I'm going through perimenopause so I'm never sure if my symptoms are RA, peri or something else.

Nauseas with meds - Help?,comment,"are you still taking methotrexate? sulfasalazine didn't personally make me nauseous (it also didn't work for my arthritis which is why i stopped it). methotrexate on the other hand caused the worst nausea i've ever experienced for 1-2 days following and i eventually stopped bc of side effects (nausea + others). zofran was the only reason i tolerated mtx for as long as i did, it really helps nausea - there are also other options doctors can prescribe for nausea.

i currently take leflunomide (along with humira + naproxen) and i have been taking it for over 2 years now. i have a much reduced appetite and nausea with leflunomide, but for the longest time i didn't realize they were side effects because they happened all day, every day, not worse immediately after leflunomide or anything (i take it every morning). for me, the side effects are not nearly as bad as other meds and leflunomide has really helped my arthritis.

i also have migraines and dysautonomia which give me nausea so maybe it isn't completely from the leflunomide, but i think leflunomide is definitely contributing to it. 

**TLDR**; leflunomide side effects kinda crept up on me and didn't seem as immediate in relation to taking the pill as opposed to methotrexate injections/pills. so your nausea definitely could be caused by that. however, there are options to help this if the medication helps - such as a zofran or other prescription for nausea, and holistic treatments for the nausea (peppermints and sea bands is what i use to combat the nausea)",4,k55b0e7,,1697479823

Rheumatoid Arthritis,post,"Hello everyone,

I just recently got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and am quite new to how all of this works so, I was hoping someone could answer my questions. Thankfully I have been doing well with rheumatoid arthritis, I have a much milder case as It only affects my right knee with inflammation that prevents me from bending and mobilising it. 

Additionally, since I hopped on some anti inflammation medication the swelling has severely decreased and allowed me to move normally. Along with that I have been taking Methotrexate weekly and Sulfasalazine daily.

I was just curious to know whether arthritis affects one’s fertility? and whether I can eventually stop taking these medications?

Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"Unfortunately this is a disease that will be with you for the rest of your life. It is progressive, so you will have to carefully  manage it with medications and lifestyle changes. You may be able to go into a remission (little to no symptoms) but you will have to continue on the meds to prevent flare ups (a sudden increase in symptoms causing pain and possibly joint damage). Any joint damage is permanent, and not taking the meds can also cause damage to organs such as heart and lungs. I know this all sounds scary, but we are lucky to have a bunch of various meds we can take to keep the disease under control. You will learn through experience what triggers can put you into a flare or worsen your symptoms - it varies from person to person, but things like stress, alcohol, diet, lack of sleep can affect you. Some form of gentle exercise, limiting processed foods, or cutting out gluten can be helpful. Fertility is not usually affected, but if you plan on getting pregnant be sure to discuss it with your Rheumatologist as some of the meds should not be taken while pregnant, but there are meds that will be safe to take. This all sounds like a lot, and it is, but once you figure out what works for you, you can live a full life in spite of having RA.  It is a journey, not a quick fix. Best of luck❤️",5,j290s8b,,1672412417
Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"Hi! I've been diagnosed since 31 (currently 38) tho I had symptoms since my early to mid 20s. 

Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive disease. It started out in my elbow and my thumb joint. It then spread. So now my hands, wrists, shoulders, knees, ankles, feet and oddly enough my jaw on both hinges have all flared at one time or another. My knee caps are also weak so when I stand up during a flare there is a good chance I could have my kneecap slip out of place too which is a whole additional level of excruciating pain. 

Thankfully my Dr who diagnosed me at 31 is a good man (not good bedside by any means) but has ALWAYS  taken me for my word and has done what he can to make  sure I'm not in constant pain and adjusting/ changing meds as needed. 

I didn't have that much luck as a younger woman - most drs focused on my weight, my dietary habits or my stress levels. It was frustrating to not get help for something that kept occuring. I even had one Dr say the arthritic nodules on my arms were calluses from me leaning against my desk while I typed at work..yeah... No they freaking weren't. They disappeared once I got on proper meds. 

I've been on 4 different meds including pain meds. I stopped taking the injection biologic at 35 when I became pregnant (some of the other ones you need to wean off first before - this one he said to just stop when you find out). I was lucky and my symptoms disappeared with pregnancy (it's not guaranteed but was a positive side effect! Haha!)  I was able to conceive within two cycles so no delay in fertility for me from the meds! 

However pain symptoms hit me like a freight train come 4 weeks after birth. Took my injection and it did nothing. I switched to a pill version and have been taking that pill version since 2020. I am generally pain free - tho weather changes do create flares in my shoulders and knees. Over the counter pain meds for 12 hours usually does the trick!

I do have damage in my hands and knees - there's no changing that now - so I know as I get older there will be more issues. Right now I'm working on just being as pain free as I can be to enjoy my life.

Rheumatoid Arthritis,comment,"Oh good! I'm glad it gave you some peace! I totally get it - a diagnosis is both a relief of finally being right that something was wrong but also scary because what does the future hold? 

This is a long term game. And honestly every day can be different! Which is both good and bad. Good when you're in pain and need a break but also after a good day a bad day can sneak up on you. 

Also something most don't actually talk about is fatigue!

I forgot it in my post because I chase a 2 year old toddler everyday now so being tired is 'normal' trait haha! 

But fatigue can be annoying because I'd do something normal - like grocery shop or be out and about for the morning and suddenly you are so tired. You can't keep your eyes open, if you lay on a couch it's a guaranteed nap even caffeine has problems touching that level of tiredness. 

So my recommendation if you find that's starting to affect you - plan it into your day. You're going to be busy? Add a half hour or hour of sitting going through email or lay in bed and scroll on your phone. Set an alarm incase you nodd off! I wish I had acknowledged it more when I was younger - I often pushed myself too hard and then I was very tired and then flares were even worse.

just tired,post,"total vent post lol. almost too tired to type this out. I just feel like it keeps getting worse. I'm at the point now where I can't even make it past 6pm without being so tired I'm dizzy. I almost had to pull over the other day while driving home. so much of my free time is spent sleeping. I just want to live a normal life. 

I'm not on meds right now because I'm worried about my current meds. I mentioned GI side effects with MTX. I know some of y'all have mentioned being switched to injections if you had GI side effects but that wasn't even offered to me. I didn't ask because I'm just so fucking tired of having to advocate for myself. I was prescribed sulfasalazine but I haven't taken it because I've read you can have GI side effects with that too. I'm currently seeing an allergist to see if there's a way I can take Enbrel again (it was really helping me but I started getting these huge injection-site welts). 

my last rheum appt he said that if I didn't do well on the sulfasalazine that insurance would probably approve the Enbrel. but insurance approval was never the problem? this is my 5th rheumatologist. my first appt with him he knew my history before I even walked in the door. apparently the third one I saw was in an affiliated hospital with the same EMR so he saw her note. even though she pretty much told me I was crazy he said he def thought I had seronegative RA and started talking about all the treatment options I hadn't tried and just really seemed to know his shit. my second appt with him it's like he didn't know anything about my history. he offered me leflunomide (that I'd already taken years ago and felt worse). and then mentioned insurance and Enbrel, seeming to forget about the injection-site reactions I had. and didn't seem concerned about the GI side effects of MTX at all; he said I could keep taking it if I wanted.

I'm just really tired. I want off this ride lol. and the only way to get better is to keep fighting and I don't have the energy left in me to fight anymore. not really sure why I'm posting this, just needed to get it out there and I know y'all will get it",13,10oqw33,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/10oqw33/just_tired/,1675047697

just tired,comment,"I was on Enbrel for awhile, and what I did to minimize the welts: take it out of the fridge about 1 hour before injecting to let it warm up, and take a Benadryl antihistamine, then ice the injection area before and after the injection. I went off Enbrel after a year because it stopped working for me and switched to Humira, a very similar drug to Enbrel - and no welts or pain with injection! Could you go onto Humira instead of Enbrel? Sorry you are feeling so awful, if you can find the right medication that works for you, you will probably feel a lot less fatigued.

How many injections did you do after you started getting the welts with Enbrel?  I had that happen too, and they eventually improved greatly. I did the same as another responder suggest and took Benedryl. I still sometimes have small reactions but it is not nearly as bad as it was.

I did an analysis a year before (before ever taking sulfasalazine) and everything was good. So we went through the IUI procedure and it didnt take. I consulted with my RA doc and she took me off the meds, within the next two months my wife got pregnant without any extra help.

28f here, diagnosed at 26, but had symptoms for a few years beforehand. Trying to figure out if I should be losing hope on there to be an effective treatment for me. I would love to hear from anyone who had a similar experience to me! I have seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, it affects my hands, knees, feet, ankle and shoulder. I have tried hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, azathioprine, humira, and enbrel. Methotrexate helped me a lot with my hands but it gave me terrible stomach problems and didnt help my other joints. Currently taking hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine because they didn't cause side effects but they didn't obviously help me either. I'm hitting the 4 month mark on an enbrel trial and it's like my pain has not changed at all, if anything it's gotten worse. I don't have the seropositive bloodwork signs to track, it's all based on MRIs and my symptoms to track the disease.",3,15czzgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/15czzgc/wondering_about_my_experience_and_if_anyone_can/,1690657232

Wondering about my experience and if anyone can relate,comment,"Oh no, do not give up! There are so many biologics out there, and you literally have nothing but time. The only thing you don't want to do is stop trying. That is when you will get into trouble. I refused drugs for about the first 10 years after diagnosis, which was easy at the time because I had a stealth disease in the early days. My rheumatoid was only found when I had a foot x-ray because I thought it was broken, and they found bone erosions. They told me RA is the only thing that does that. When I finally had symptoms after 10 years, I went on Enbrel, which was good for about 6 years, and my biologic use has been like that ever since. Except I added 25 mg. methotrexate injection weekly about 10 years ago, and that makes all of my meds work better. 

My doctor hasn't used labs for inflammation markers. It's all on patient reported results, and she will take x-rays of hands or feet if there are questions.

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,post,"hi there! all kind responses will be much appreciated :) 

context: i (22F) have been diagnosed with RA for only about 10 months now and am currently in the process of choosing between two different advanced therapy biologic options. i have been on triple therapy of mtx, hydroxychloroquine (plaquenil), and sulfasalazine for 8 months now without seeing the greatest results (definitely less symptoms but still not symptom free, consistently and constantly struggling with pain and fatigue). i am grateful to be in a position to be able to be the one making the decision but also its a fairly big decision and it feels somewhat daunting! also i have just recently found this sub and it has been so reassuring to read other posts and to see the support that is so clearly present here; i am sure we are all too aware of how lonely this RA journey can seem so this is just really great to see/be a part of.

as i am in the process of making this decision i am trying to gain knowledge about the science side of the medications (the mechanisms of action in the body/how they work to help RA) but i am also super curious about the 'human' side of the medications (what it is like actually being on them) and hearing this from 'real' people and not just in medical/statistical jargon from clinical studies lol!

the options given to me by my rheumatologist are Cimzia (injectable TNF inhibitor) and Rinvoq (pill JAK inhibitor). the decision is ultimately mine to make at this point but he does say that he would choose the Rinvoq; yet for some reason, i just can't easily get past the fact that JAK inhibitors are relatively new and there isn't the same level/amount of long term data to study the long term effects of JAKs compared to the TNFs.

my question(s): any advice with making this decision? anyone with experience being on these medications? (good experiences and bad experiences are welcome!) how concerned do i need to be about the risks/scary side effects of medications like these? any words of encouragement to help see past the scary parts? any words of encouragement in general lol!

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,comment,"I (44F) was on methotrexate for about 3 months since my seropositive RA diagnosis in November 2022. I didn’t see significant improvement so my doctor mentioned trying Enbrel, which is a TNF inhibitor. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction. It made me break out in hives all over my back, stomach and arms. I stopped taking it and saw my doctor who then recommended Rinvoq. He said most people did extremely well on it. 

I started the medicine and felt great for the first two weeks. But then I started to feel flu-like symptoms. Within a day I had the highest fever I’ve ever had in my life. I tried to bring it down on my own but nothing worked. Decided to go to the ER and they admitted me to the hospital. As they were taking me to the room I had seizure (something that has never happened to me). I was in the hospital for 7 days total and the first 4 days they had no idea what was wrong with me. I just kept getting sicker and sicker. They had me on IVs, several broad spectrum antibiotics hoping one would work and magnesium because my blood pressure was dangerously low. Finally they tested me for strep pneumonia and did a CT scan and that came back positive. They gave me a different antibiotic and steroid shots and I finally started to feel better. I was sent home with another round of antibiotics and told I can restart the Rinvoq. 

I knew I couldn’t take it while on antibiotics or with an active infection so I waited about three weeks to take it again. I took it right after dinner and in less than 30 minutes, my face turned bright red, I developed a fever and I was shivering uncontrollably. Then the vomiting started. I had to be rushed to the ER again. I almost passed out in triage and they rushed me to a room. Basically I was in septic shock. I spent another three days in the hospital, this time in the ICU. After explaining the series of events to a multitude of doctors, the consensus was that I had a severe reaction to Rinvoq during both hospitalizations.

It has taken me months to recover. I’m just now starting to feel like myself again and getting my energy and strength back. My doctor just started me on Plaquenil, which he says is the mildest of all the medications. It’s too soon to tell if it will work. In the meantime, I have prednisone to help me deal with the joint pain. But let me tell you, building up the courage to try another medicine was tough. The mental struggle from the medical anxiety was almost as bad as the physical pain I went through. 

I know this is a negative story, and I don’t mean to scare you. But I wish I had seen stories like this when I was starting out with these new meds, especially because I had the same concern of it being a much more recent drug and possibly not studied as much. But when I asked about possible side effects, I was kind of dismissed like every drug has side effects. And while I understand that, this one almost killed me. 

Even now when I googled Rinvoq to see if others had experienced what I experienced, I couldn’t find any one who had gone through something similar. Maybe that means my experience is extremely rare and it won’t happen to you. I truly hope that’s the case. But at least you know what’s possible and to look out for any strange symptoms. I wish you the best on this journey.",5,jt39fvr,,1690092303

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,comment,"My rheumatologist also gave me the option and I chose Rinvoq because I was scared of the possible site reactions from injecting TNF inhibitors. 

I’ve been on it for 2 months now (in combination with the methotrexate that I’ve been on for 2 years) and I haven’t had any major side effects but it also doesn’t seem to be doing much. I felt great for about 2 weeks then got a UTI and even though I didn’t stop taking the Rinvoq, it’s like I just reverted back to how I was before I started it.  I’ve had a consistent mild sore throat since I’ve started taking it and it makes me tired. I take it before bed and the tiredness seems to wear off by morning. I’m a bit concerned with how quickly I got a UTI when I haven’t had one in about 20 years until now so definitely going to be watching for that…

Overall it’s not bad, but also doesn’t seem to be helping much yet. I know they say it can take 3 months to really see if it’s working, like all RA meds, so I’m staying hopeful but I have a feeling I’ll be switching to TNF inhibitors next month.",1,jt5ip2h,,1690137834

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,comment,"thank you for sharing this with me and for the good luck! i am so glad to hear that Rinvoq has worked well for you and that you have found the right medication for you and have even experienced periods of remission on it! that's the dream! 

can i ask how long you were on the other medications before they started to work less well for you?

fingers crossed that if i also choose it, it will also take the edge off my fatigue as well. for me it's easier to 'suck it up' and deal with the joint pain than it is to deal with the fatigue (not that having to deal with the pain is easy by any means lol!) 

i'm not super certain of obvious benefits of the injection compared to the pill...in my opinion it seems so equal in terms of pros and cons of each; like if the injection has a con for one reason then the pill has the pro of that reason (and if the pill has a con for a reason then the injection has the pro for that reason). i think this is part of the reason that it is such a difficult decision because one option or the other doesn't stick out to me as a clear 'winner'!",1,jt682ap,,1690148411

Let’s talk meds!,post,"Hi all!

I’m 35f. I was diagnosed in the summer of 2022. I first was prescribed hydroxychloroquine. I take it 5 days a week. It’s ok. I was still getting flare ups though so now I’m still on that but also taking sulfasalazine as well, 7 days a week. I’ve been doing both for about 3 months now. 

I’m still getting flare ups but i guess they aren’t as severe as they were when i wasn’t on medication at all. I just get so annoyed, like are these meds doing anything or ? 

Just curious to hear what you’re on.

My Rheumatologist says our next plan is to wait 3 more months, see if there’s any more progress then if not try certolizumab. I do know that’s a lot more pricey and it’s injections which I’m not very happy about. 

Wondering if anyone has any experience with these?

Oh I was also prescribed meloxicam for the pain… but I’ve only used it once or twice and didn’t notice anything???

I should also note I still like to enjoy alcohol on the weekends so I’m always weary/ trying to ensure whatever I take is still ok enough with that.

Backstory: My RA has not been controlled so far (currently taking Humira and sulfasalazine) and they are beginning to question if RA is the right diagnosis because none of my previous DMARDs worked except a very short stent of sulfasalazine working, and now Humira doesn’t seem to be doing anything either.

High white blood cell/high lymphocytes,comment,As a medical student you may be able to help - what does it signify if WBCs are high in urine but not in blood tests?,1,j1ri19y,,1672087759
High white blood cell/high lymphocytes,comment,"Yes! So keep in mind I am not licensed or anything yet, so obviously discuss your concerns with your own medical team, but leukocytes in your urine are common in autoimmune disorders. If you have it present in your urine but not blood, it could be that your symptoms are just beginning, or it could just be a bacterial infection or something similar. The biggest sign that it’s autoimmune though is if it’s consistently elevated over time and doesn’t dip back down. If you aren’t sure, see if it correlates with your symptoms (if you have an autoimmune disorder).

One of RA’s biggest mimics is ELS (aka lupus). Lupus is known to have heavy kidney involvement, and urinalysis is one of the major tests that are used to diagnose lupus. 

This is a good resource that breaks things down well! I’m sure your medical team mentioned this, but it can be very difficult to correctly diagnose autoimmune disorders effectively BECAUSE of how similarly the disease can manifest. [RA vs Lupus](https://creakyjoints.org/living-with-arthritis/symptoms/lupus-vs-rheumatoid-arthritis/)

If you need a little hope…,post,"I know I’ve commented on several posts where others have expressed the same frustrations. I’ve been experiencing inflammatory arthritis for over a year now. My first rheumatologist was super hesitant to treat me with anything other than hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine, both which my body rejected. The whole time I was throwing up every day and in and out of the ER trying to take these meds my rheumatologist was not very responsive or helpful. He wouldn’t give me nausea meds nor any stronger nsaids to help with pain. He then told me to to stop meds and wait four months to see him again and if I got worse we would look at starting something else. I couldn’t wait another four months in pain so I found a second rheumatologist who listened to me and put me on methotrexate right away and even prescribed meloxicam for bad pain days. I went from basically bed ridden to baseline normal in two days. I’ve had 5 good days in a row this week and it’s only week one. It’s may take a while to find the right med but when you find yours - it’s magic. Also, if you feel stuck with your rheumatologist don’t be afraid to get a second opinion.

If you need a little hope…,comment,"RA is an autoimmune disease. It is triggered by your immune system reacting to foreign substances which cause you to make autoantibodies which attack your own tissues.
The responsible immune system involved is that of your gut tissue.

Some people find that by keeping a careful log of everything they eat, drink, etc. each day and noting flare ups, good days, bad days, etc. you can often work out what that substance was. A journal is also useful to track meds and symptoms.

If you Google, you will find that many people have found grains to be such an antigen, e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, etc. I am one of those.

A big clue that food is involved is that your RA symptoms always improve when you fast (e.g. you are ill and can't eat much). Another is that your  symptoms change when on holiday and your diet has changed.


So 1. Keep a diary, 2. Try a grain free diet for 1 month.

With RA, everyone seems to be different. Some people have shown fantastic improvement by avoiding certain foods, some improve on a certain med while to others that med makes them even worse.

Only you know what affects you. Your doctor can only advise but it is you who are going through the pain and suffering. You need to research what an autoimmune disease is, log your details and work out what substances may be affecting you.

As an example celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that can be successfully treated by simply avoiding certain glutens. Most celiacs are sensitive to one particular gluten e.g. wheat gluten, rye gluten or barley gluten. But it has been found that about 20% react to a different substance (e.g. the gluten in oats). For those 20%, they have to work out what that substance is.

RA, celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases are all closely related, often symptoms overlap and doctors find it hard to distinguish between them because the spectrum of symptoms are so wide.
 
With my RA, if I avoid all grains then my symptoms improve dramatically but if I eat some gluten-free breads, I get a bad flare up the next morning. So I seem to be sensitive to something else in some breads , not just wheat.

I can eat rice (which is a grain and so does contain rice gluten) with no problems. I have not tested myself on other specific grains apart from wheat ( I made my own bread using only wheat flour with very bad results which was actually how I discovered all this stuff about grains and RA and that it was a 'thing'!).",2,ja22zdx,,1677394646
If you need a little hope…,comment,"It’s still blows my mind how differently everyone reacts to meds. I know sulfasalazine works for so many people but my body said no.

Overheating(?) from SSZ (Sulfasalazine) and other change(s),post,"Hi All, 

Some background: I grew up with severe eczema from head to toe (11 months old until present, 28yo). I was diagnosed with RA about 4 months ago and had been on SSZ for some time.   


I'm trying to understand if what I'm experiencing is causation or correlation-- of course, I don't expect a clear cut answer here as everybody is different, but I'm hoping to understand more trends. 

1) SSZ is definitely helping my RA. I noticed that my eczema is also MUCH more manageable. Does anyone else experience this? Or no change(if you have both eczema + RA)? 

2) I've been working out/doing high-intensity workouts since I was 11yo. I used to get pretty sweaty, but never toooo crazy. I noticed that after I started SSZ, I'm always POURING sweat. I start sweating even after doing planche tucks for 10-15 seconds (and only from that). I'm also unable to do distance runs as easily-- I feel like I'm overheating. 

3) I'm always feeling thirsty. When I first started SSZ, I was probably drinking close to 1.5-2 gallons of water each day. I'm definitely not as thirsty these days, but still probably putting down 1-1.25 gallons each day. 

4) When I'd get sick, my mucus would be the same dye(?) color as the SSZ tablets. Uhmm... admittedly something I prob should be talking to my doc about lol... I'm doing that right now. hahaha

My story- any advice?,post,"
Hi everyone! I’m not sure what I’m really asking for… maybe just support. I’m having one of those nights where I can’t sleep due to pain so I’m just awake and anxious. I wanted to see if maybe anyone has any advice about things I’m going through. 

I (29F) was diagnosed with seronegative RA late 2022. I had started having a lot of pain in my hands in August 2022 but I’d already had a lot of chronic pain for years. The rheumatologist had me take prednisone for a few months, which I definitely don’t want to be on long term. It did help somewhat but the higher doses that helped the pain also gave me panic attacks. So far I’ve tried Sulfasalazine (gave me headaches) and methotrexate tablets & injectable (gave me stomach problems). Now I’m on leflunomide (no side effects yet but my pain is also worse than ever). I’m still taking the folic acid for 8 weeks after stopping the MTX. I’m also on diclofenac and cymbalta. 

I’ve been so stressed about work. I work part time and am getting a masters degree. A lot of things in my life seem to have taken a backseat because it takes all the energy I have just to focus on school and work. I was told by HR that I don’t qualify for any FMLA because I’m part time. They recommended I try to get disability. So I got that approved and I know my doctor asked them to let me call out up to 4 days a month, but HR only approved 1 day a month. There are some months where this is fine, but usually I’m calling out 3-4 days. Luckily my boss is very understanding (we work in healthcare) and he said he doesn’t really care how much I call in as long as I keep communicating with him. He said the most HR can do is tell him “hey she’s called out too much” but it’s up to him if I get fired and he won’t do that. I do trust him but as you can imagine I’m still relatively uneasy knowing that my disability only covers 1 day and my job basically is relying on his word. I was told there was a medical disability I could take for up to 12 weeks but it’s not job protected. It’s also unpaid which would be really hard for me because I’m already living paycheck to paycheck. Within the next year my department will also be moved so we’ll have new management. I’m very worried and assuming that my new boss won’t be as accommodating as my current one. On top of that, I have to wait until May 2024 to get a surgery that I really need. My insurance wouldn’t cover it until I’ve been at my current workplace for 3 years. So my health also hinges on me being able to keep my job until then.

Otherwise, I just feel like I’ve been so depressed and in pain 24/7 for about a year now. None of the medication has worked well and I feel so alone. My boyfriend is really supportive but I know there’s no way he can really understand. Especially on the days I feel like I can’t work, I get so irritated with him when he asks me if I can tough it out. I feel like I’ve been doing that for a year and I’m exhausted. I can’t imagine going on like this much longer. My hands are always in so much pain. Trying to simply write something down feels like when you’re lifting weights and you’re just like “come on just push one more time.” All my muscles ache. I’m constantly hot, like dripping sweat all the time and having 3 fans on me at home when it’s 65*F. My legs are always aching and it often wakes me up at night. Every time I tell my rheumatologist how miserable I am I feel like I’m brushed off. I’m always told to just “wait a little longer” but nothing changes and I’m not sure what I’m waiting for. I’m trying to find a new rheumatologist but a lot of them where I live aren’t accepting new patients. I think I’m just having a hard time adjusting to my new level of physicality. I used to be someone so motivated and would get so much done in a day. Now I study for a few minutes and look around at how messy I’ve let my home get because I can’t stand up long enough to clean it. It’s been making me feel extremely bad about myself and it sort of just feels like I’m in this little bubble of pain that separates me from everyone else. 
Anyway, that’s about it. I’m so sorry this was so long. I just wanted to tell my story. Thanks for reading.",10,16e4x3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16e4x3r/my_story_any_advice/,1694263681
My story- any advice?,comment,"My opinion, so take it as an opinion. You have too much going on to focus on your wellness. I think you need to take a pause on grad school. Can you finish the semester and take a break or is it early enough for you to take a break now? You can work with the department/advisor and the disability resource center. 

Next, do some research into finding a new drug. Go to your rheumatologist and tell them you have a plan you would like to try. The biologics are a great option. The drug companies have funds to help you afford it. Get on prednisone right now so you can have enough pain relief to get on the new drug. You can ween yourself off in the future. Ask for an anti inflammatory prescription like naproxen. You have to advocate for yourself. Don’t take the status quo from your doctor. Tylenol pm can help with sleep. 

Tell your boyfriend what you need from him. He doesn’t know. My husband gives me my injections of Cimzia because I have a hard time with needles. I ask for help opening containers or lifting things. I also need hugs and I ask for them. 

Rest and sleep when you need it. 
Find an outlet for depression and anxiety. For example, I started a night time routine. It’s weird but helps. I floss, wash my face, put on moisturizer, and brush my teeth. I tidy up the kitchen. Then I get in bed and journal. I have a journal with prompts to answer. I put lotion on my hands and feet. I feel like a old fashion woman from the 1960s. The routine has provided calm for me. I make sure to take some deep breaths. Maybe you can find something that works for you. 

You are in a tough spot right now. Be kind to yourself. Advocate for yourself. Take control as much as you can. It will get better. I have faith in you!

My story- any advice?,comment,"Sounds like you're really having a hell of a time. I'm so sorry. Could you possibly try a biologic? If copays are a problem, most of the biologic companies have $ assistance for people with private insurance.

With all you're doing with school and work both, that would probably be tough for someone without arthritis. For you, though, with the extra load you have to carry, it's even tougher. I think it's somewhat miraculous that you're able to do all you are with the pain you have. I remember years ago when I was in grad school, and a prof told me just that - what I was doing was miraculous. Made me feel kind of proud. The work and stress really took a toll on me though. Is there any way you might be able to carry a lighter load with your grad program?

You are not alone with this. I live with pain whenever I'm conscious and especially when I move around because I've had JRA so long. Lots of people are here to help you through this. 

Hang in there. Things are bound to get easier for you in time. ❤️💕

Edit: never apologize for writing a long post if that's what you need to do. Besides, I enjoy reading long posts like yours and tend to write long ones too. 😊KOKO",10,jztcufu,,1694267818
My story- any advice?,comment,"The spoon theory is very useful to adapt to chronic illnesses: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory

First, get on a biologic. Advocate for yourself that the existing meds are not working for you. Find a new Rheumat if you have to. Pain is the main indicator of disease activity and not blood markers. I’m Seronegative and my doctor is treating me based off my symptoms entirely. All biologic companies have discount programs that would cover your deductibles. Call your insurance and get approval for biologics like Humira. They are far better at slowing disease progression. Tell the doctor you are in a critical phase of your life with completing a master and working. You cannot do that with constant pain and you need treatment. 

Second, talk to your university. They should be able to give you a semester off for medical reasons which should give you enough time to find a treatment that works. If financial aid is an issue, you can try to seek exemption on medical grounds. Point is, talk to people at your grad school. You’ll likely find people are more helpful than you’d expect. 

Third, find a job that has better HR policies. Work from home as much as you can. I know the job market is tough right now, and finding a job is a stress in itself. But you have to find a way to reduce stress on yourself. Noone like living in a dirty messy house. But ask yourself, is it the most important thing in your life right now? Prioritising is the most important thing to you right now. Again, ask for help. 

You have a very painful life changing disease. You cannot get through this without making major changes and you are going to need to ask for help. As no one can know what you are going through. I’ve had to inform my work of my condition- I absolutely hate anyone knowing my personal business. I’ve had to ask my spouse to take over the house work as doing any housework brings on a lot of pain for me. My spouse didn’t understand how bad I was till I told him in detail how I feel- my joints feel like theyve been glued together. I’m in pain every second of everyday. If I try to tough it out and keep on going as normal, I’ll crash into bed and not be able to go to even the bathroom. Tell your BF to read about RA fatigue and pain, and develop some real empathy. It’s not regular arthritis that happens in one joint. All your joints are failing you. Repeat the message till it sinks in. Stop carrying on as normal. When you do that, it makes your bf believe you are alright. I tried and I got so much worse. I do what I absolutely have to now and I’m feeling much better. You’ll also feel more in control of your life and pain when you start making decisions prioritising your health. 

Chronic pain is a whole different beast. And RA is worse because it limits your mobility severely, yet you look completely normal. Depressions is common. Antidepressants might help, but what I’ve found has helped is being open about what I’m going through and seeking support and help. If your bf refuses to give it, I would be reevaluating the whole relationship honestly. Point him to the spoon theory. 

When you can’t do something, say I don’t have enough spoons! I’ve had to delay important things in life as I just cannot sustain much right now. I’m barely able to get through half a day of low activity. It’s okay to take steroids for shorter term: a few months is really alright. Years and years are damaging. Take NSAIDs. The inflammation will cause you more damage than any medicines can. This is a tough tough time but you will get better. You have to advocate for yourself with doctors, at work, at college and with your bf. No one will just help us because we are in pain! I hope you get better soon. You are so strong to be doing so much when you are in such pain. You can do this! Good luck!",5,jzwosdg,,1694315604
My story- any advice?,comment,"Hey, I really agree with the previous poster that for your well-being you're going to need to cut back some with all you're doing. Work and grad school together is a lot for a healthy person to handle. Experiencing constant pain while doing all that is IMO maybe asking too much of yourself. In no way does that mean you're somehow weak or less than. You just have an extra load to carry.

In my prior post, I mentioned how driving myself mercilessly in grad school while in intense pain and needing hip replacements took a real toll on me. I was determined to try to go at the same pace as everyone else and denied that I had a hell of an extra load to bear. I refused to admit to myself that I was ""different."" Well I ended up in a very severe major depressive episode, feeling panicked all the time, and trying to drink my pain away. I had to cut back or I might have ended up even worse off.

I don't know if any of this is at all helpful for you, but I'm hoping you might find something to relate to in my experience. Perhaps it's time to cut yourself some slack. I can't really say; only you can decide that. 💔",3,jzwdbe7,,1694310348

Found my first skin nodule,post,"I just found my first skin nodule on my left hand (middle finger) this morning, and it’s been difficult for me. If you look at some of my prior posts, you’ll see I’m on Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) and was on sulfasalazine which was majorly impacting my mental health and giving me brain fog so I stopped taking it. My doc has prescribed Orencia which is still in process (this could be a whole other rant - insurance companies are the worst), and I’ve been in a lot of pain in the last couple of weeks.

My rheumatologist keeps telling me he doesn’t notice swelling or joint changes which I feel isn’t accurate. I got my nails done about a week and a half ago and posted a picture on social media. Then I noticed how “bumpy” my knuckles look. I was hoping it was just angle or lighting, but looking at some previous nail photos I feel like there are definite changes. I figure the pics would be good reference even though one is a different hand.

LDN for RA- vitamins- vaccinations?,post,"Hey guys ❤️ Apologies in advance for the long post. 

I was officially dx’d just a few weeks ago w/ seronegative RA. Took some time to really process; I’m glad to finally have an answer. 

My rheumy started w/ Plaquenil, and 5 days in I developed Steven Johnson Syndrome and had to stop. (Sulfasalazine poses the same risk). 

Fast forward to a wk and a half ago, we decided to trial low dose naltrexone for multiple other comorbidites- MTX if this doesn’t work. (I have adrenal PCOS, hypothyroidism, I suspect Sjögren’s syndrome but my rheumy will draw labs in a few months to R/O). I’m really sensitive to meds- started at 0.25mg & so far I’m up to .75 w/ my rheumys permission & it’s actually helping. 🤞🏽🤞🏽

My 1st question, for those that have been successful on LDN w/ RA, how do you know what the “sweet spot is”? Should pain be “reasonably low level tolerable” or should it be completely gone?! 🤷🏽‍♀️

2nd question, I started fish oil. I’ve read diff/ posts in the community that vitamins are/aren’t recommended for our already over reactive immune system? I take vit D 50,000 units- & the fatigue/brain fog was so bad that I started a MVI. I wondered about turmeric and fish oil- (1 versus the other? Together?🤷🏽‍♀️), and CoQ10. I’ve noticed months leading up to that my body had a harder time fighting things- for the last 2 weeks my body was trying to fight going into a full blown cold. Leading to my 3rd question… 

What’s y’all’s opinion on flu vaccines? 

Random 4th question- my scalp itches. At 1st I thought I was nuts until I seen similar post in this community about that symptom. I’ve tried every hair oil under the sun, tea tree/peppermint- LDN gives me vivid dreams- I dreamt I had lice last night if that tells you anything 🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤣.  I’ve had my husband look and my scalp is clean, no redness, no irritation, just itchy. Any suggestions? 

Always welcome to any suggestions, and really thankful for this community! 🙏🏽",3,1752yl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/1752yl5/ldn_for_ra_vitamins_vaccinations/,1696990351

Probably not the answer, but I had itchy scalp once decades ago and it cleared up with dandruff shampoo (selsun blue), I think it might have been a mild fungal infection in my case. You should maybe consult a dermatologist.

They're mostly for my neuro dx, except I started the the biotin when my body hair all fell out, my skin became painfully dry, and my nails started breaking below the quick. I believe that's because I'm on Plaquinel. My body hair has never come back properly, but my nails and skin have definitely benefitted from my supplements.

Medicine/DMARDs for 28 yo (who eventually wants kids)?,post,"My Rheumatologist that I’ve seen before is really flexible with medication recommendations which is a good and also frustrating sometimes. I was diagnosed in June and first rx was Hydroxychloriquine, not very effective. Second apt a month later was with my PA and he recommended a Biologic (Enebrel) and suggested we do a blood test to see how successful anti-TNFs are on me. I didn’t want to take it before doing the test so we decided on Sulfasalazine at my request. Not much improvements, but slightly. Test came back that I have a 10% chance that antiTNFs would help, so probably a good thing it wasn’t prescribed. He made no changes because I was doing AIP at the same time, which honestly  I think the diet was helping more than the medicine because once I started introducing things back in I spiraled and had coffee, milk ect and had flares. So we doubled dose of sulfasalazine. I have my next apt in December and he mentioned that since I want to have kids in the future I’m really limited to what drugs I can take. 

My question is what meds has your doctor recommended if you want to have children in future? I know methotrexate he said might cause sterility. He said other drugs in the dmards have not many studies. My main concern is I have a joint that has been bloated since the beginning of the year and I’m worried that it might cause permanent damage. Other than that pain is luckily very mild (for now), but I’m in a field that I use my hands everyday and it can be exacerbated.

Medicine/DMARDs for 28 yo (who eventually wants kids)?,comment,"just because the prismRA test said that you might not have an adequate response to TNF inhibitors doesn't mean that you definitely won't. it's a fairly new test and afaik is not super common to use at this time. I've heard some/most TNF inhibitors are safe during pregnancy (the cleveland clinic article I linked below states this). it would be better to take a TNF inhibitor and it end up not working than to never try at all, as there's still a chance it *will* work

as far as other medications, there's studies showing that the risk of infertility from MTX [appears low](https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/92/10/551/1531030). this is just one that I've linked but if you search I found others as well. leflunomide is unsafe for pregnancy and takes two years to fully clear your system. JAK inhibitors (xeljanz, rinvoq, and olumiant), IL-6 inhibitors (actemra, kevzara), orencia (T-cell inhibitor), and rituxan (b-cell inhibitor) are considered unsafe for pregnancy, but it doesn't mean you couldn't use these until you are trying to conceive. many people actually feel their RA symptoms improve during pregnancy, so taking something up until pregnancy, stopping while you're pregnant, and then resuming afterwards isnt unreasonable either.

here's some good articles from the [cleveland clinic](https://www.google.com/amp/s/health.clevelandclinic.org/rheumatoid-arthritis-pregnancy/amp/) and [arthritis foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/healthy-living/family-relationships/family-planning/arthtiris-medications-during-pregnancy) about RA/meds and pregnancy

Shoulder pain,post,"Been diagnosed since end of March this year. I am on Methotrexate one a week, Hydroxychloroqu once a day and Sulfasalazine two times a day and only the last 3 months.  I also take Diclofenac sometimes at lunch and at night, I myself am trying not to have to take the Diclofenac. 

I have been off presindone for about 6 or 7 weeks now. Since being off the presindone my shoulder pain has come back but not all the time I am going to attempt to explain lol. My left shoulder which has always been worse out of the 2 is usually now in a dull pain if I don't keep it in a certain position putting on clothes, reaching to get something behind me, trying to take off my bra with that hand and even reaching the pick something up off the floor is a big no moment where I get shooting pain in my shoulder that almost brings me to tears each time. Since my body at times forgets because it isn't in constant pain this happens a few times a day if I am moving on instinct and not intentionally. Been having trouble sleeping on my side and stomach again since it has started because at night is the worst. (why I am still taking Diclofenac at night for me)

Some days are better then others but as we all know there is never a guarantee. Yes the right shoulder hurts as well at times but nothing like the left so far. 

I called my Doctor a few weeks ago and let her know and also mentioned I was ok waiting until my next appointment to figure it out as it will be at the end of this month. She did let me know that if I wanted to I could take a low dose of presindone and just let her know and we would discuss things then. 

So far I did not start the presindone again because I really wanted to give my body a break. 

I assume most advice is going to be take the presindone or I am either going to increase some meds or start a new one but anyone else have issues similar?

hydrocloxachlorine,post,"Edit: Hydroxychloroquine

First time posting but I wanted to get everyone’s experience on Hydroxychloroquine. 

I’ve been put on it recently in conjunction with methotrexate injections and Rituximab infusions which I have been on both since Feb this year. I have very active RA and these are the only two drugs that I have been on which have made a significant improvement over the other 7+ ones I have been put on.

I feel like I have my life back! I too researched MTX and saw all the horror stories online. After the first dose, my stomach was upset and my heart rate felt a bit faster. But those symptoms have gone away. No hair loss. No tiredness but I purposely take the pills with dinner close to bedtime so I can sleep off any side effects. My energy levels the next day are perfectly normal. The pain is virtually all gone. The only other side effect I’ve noticed is that it’s easier to get sick with a suppressed immune system.

Positive methotrexate stories,comment,"Remember that the ones with horror stories are talking the loudest! Those of us doing fine with MTX are probably just getting on with life and so the conversation can be a bit horror-heavy. I've been on MTX for two years and here's what I can share/recommend, to think about with your own research and from the experiences of others: 

1) start taking your daily folic acid a few days before starting the MTX to prepare your system

2) take the folic acid every day religiously and consider adding a multivitamin if you don't already take one to help ensure your body's getting the nutrients it needs. I avoid taking any of these with breakfast, as I read that coffee can impede nutrient absorption and I'm not willing to give up morning coffee! So I take my folic acid and vits with lunch or dinner.

3) hair care: I don't know your hair situation, but if you're concerned about losing any, here are some tips - sleep on a silk pillow to extra insure against hair loss (but the folic acid should prevent that, as it does for most users); do not use any elastic hair bands ever, as they pull on hair leading to breakage and more loss from the roots; get plenty of ""good fats"" in your diet - olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, etc, and plenty of Vitamin D.

4) cut back on greasy, sugary, and overly processed foods to help your stomach manage the MTX better  - you don't have to cut them out entirely, just try to nourish your body with nutritious foods 80-90% of the time 

5) split your MTX dose - I take half my pills with breakfast and half with dinner every Saturday, to help guard against gastric distress, as recommended by my rheum 

6) If you have a standard M-F working life, take your MTX on the weekend so that if you do experience any fatigue or stomach issues you have the weekend to manage them.",3,ix9yzhl,,1669066875

I follow the Mediterranean diet, lots of fruit and veg, chicken or fish, olive oil. I tried cutting out gluten but it didn't help me so I do eat bread and pasta. I'm sorry you have RA on top of pots.

Finally a diagnosis! Diet?,comment,"Taking a bit of a different view on this… maybe I’m reading your post incorrectly, but it sounds like you’ve already lost a lot of weight because of loss of appetite? Honestly, if that is the case, my personal view is that you should eat what you can so you don’t continue to lose weight. Have you asked your doctor for their advice on this?  At one point I had a lot of stomach issues and could barely eat, lost 20 lbs in six weeks… one thing that I was able to get down was smoothies, and I also had soups quite often. I also found that eating very small amounts throughout the day also helped, and I found protein bars that I could tolerate and added those in. 
Anyway, personally, changes I made to my diet didn’t have any effect on my joints, and if you’ve already lost a lot of weight I would really focus on what you *can* eat so you don’t lose more weight… but this is obviously just my personal opinion and I hope you have a good doctor helping you navigate it.

I started prednisone a month later so I’ve not really experience appetite suppression, but if you already struggle to keep weight on I would be mindful of that as well. My rheumatologist also said that eating clean will overall improve your health, but diet doesn’t really play a significant role in improving RA specifically in his opinion.  Medication and listening to our bodies (resting during flares, exercising when we feel well) are our best bets in combating this horrible disease. He’s one of the best in our state,practicing for several decades, and my PCP called him personally in order to get me in because he’s so booked up there’s no appointments available for over a year, so I trust his opinion and expertise :)",4,jshablh,,1689702100
Finally a diagnosis! Diet?,comment,"I think you are better off keeping a diary of things that may be the cause of flares.  You will eventually have a very good understanding of triggers, and know the foods you want to avoid.  Many RA sufferers are like you and have waited a lifetime for a diagnosis.  It is insane that it happens, but we are at the mercy of doctors who don’t know what they are dealing with.  

Take it easy, don’t be hard on yourself, and get acquainted with your medications.  Do your research, ask the right questions, and always speak your truth.  You are your only advocate.  

PS:  I don’t think there is a set diet - or at least I haven’t found it.

Finally a diagnosis! Diet?,comment,"I haven’t found a diet or eating certain foods makes me feel better. Instead, what I’ve found is certain foods make me feel worse. Potatoes make my hands swell up like balloons now. So do peanuts and chickpeas. Wheat in small amounts doesn’t bother me, but eating a lot of it does. Alcohol is no longer something I can enjoy. I’ve had 4 drinks since my diagnosis a year and a half ago, with results ranging from extra pain and swelling to being pretty much bed-ridden. And then I have just some new straight-up allergies. Red food coloring makes my face itch and gives me a headache. 

Unfortunately, it’s a trial and error process. I dislike elimination diets because they make you more susceptible to new food intolerances, but that’s the only way I’ve been able to figure out which foods cause me problems.",3,jsh5x46,,1689700447

Finally a diagnosis! Diet?,comment,I’ve heard it’s different for everyone. Sure you can try the anti-inflammatory diet but not everyone reacts poorly to “inflammatory” foods. And be careful doing your research on what is considered a food that causes inflammation and doesn’t. There is way too much information and people giving their opinion on what they think is an anti-inflammatory food. There are certain foods that are more obvious that they are anti-inflammatory so you could start with adding them to your diet. I made the mistake of listening to every article about what is anti-inflammatory and I barely ate for weeks. The stress of not knowing what to eat added to my pain.,2,jswhpfd,,1689965508
Finally a diagnosis! Diet?,comment,"Congratulations on finally getting a diagnosis! Damn, I can’t imagine how your situation feels but I can share with you what I’m doing. My rheumatologist told me no red meat, no dairy, and no gluten/carbs. I found out that I couldn’t have alcohol the hard way when I had one shot of an expensive liquor and woke up the next morning in a terrible state. Doc said no carbs but I still eat rice, rice noodles, and gluten-free oatmeal. I weigh 157 but originally weighed 167 when diagnosed. I eat seafood/fish, chicken, veggies, fruits, and sometimes mushrooms. For gaining weight, I don’t know if you like fish but maybe you could have fatty salmon or chicken thighs. I also eat buckwheat soba noodles because they’re less messy to cook. I also try to have chia seed pudding with fruit to cram my nutrition and fiber in. If I don’t feel like chewing, I put chia seeds in my tea to drink. I don’t snack a lot but the snacks I enjoy are seaweed, Crab Roe Flavor Broad Beans snack, rice crackers, imitation crab sticks, carrots, cucumber, turkey ham, lettuce wrap sandwich, nuts, plantain chips, and fruits. My mom recently discovered these gluten-free coconut cookie straws from Costco. Costco has a lot of varieties for allergen free food.

I was taken off of hydroxychloroquinine out of an abundance of caution years ago when I was diagnosed with hearing loss that was probably unrelated.

Plaquenil doesn't really have any side effects for me as far as i know, especially now that my dosage is lower. Methotrexate gives me little ulcers in my mouth or at the side of my lips from time to time. The main bitch of a side effect (though possibly also related to catching covid a while ago?) is that I get sick often and recover veeeeery slow. Always had a bit of a weak immune system so this stuff just made it worse. A light cold can take a week to pass over. The flu might take up 2-3 weeks.

Then I got a spotted rash on arms chest face and neck. After doing it, I did notice my pain came back stronger. The second med I took was sulfasalizine. I had headaches everyday, I couldn't always remember the night dose, and I still was hurting in common and random places, so my rheumy suggested mtx. Pain also got worse after stopping this med.

Nervous about starting hydroxychloroquine,post,"I’ve been having some mild joint swelling in my hands (particularly the MCP joints) and morning stiffness, as well as an increase in my baseline of fatigue (I have fibromyalgia so it’s nothing new really) and my rheumatologist decided that, while we wait my symptoms out (unsure if it’s reactive arthritis from some viral infections I had within the last six months or early autoimmune issues, given a family history and some iffy labs previously) and wait on some lab results, that I should take plaquenil. I already picked up my prescription and will likely start it tonight. 

I’m familiar with the med because my mom has been on it (and I’ve learned about it in nursing school), but I’m just nervous that there’s nothing “wrong enough” with me to start an anti-rheumatic med.

Further, you might have a unique viewpoint here because professionally (this is a guess, obv) you have been exposed to people who are very ill and require your help.

Do you think this is related? Also—has anyone been drinking on this? I want to enjoy a few glasses of Prosecco over the holidays. But not sure if I should.

I am also on hydroxychloroquine which hasn’t been a problem at all for the 6 months I have been on it. Just wasn’t working well enough

UPDATE: I had a zoom appointment with my primary doctor and he gave me great info. He said that my reaction is very very common and to give it a month because most people adjust to it within a month. He also added Pantoprazole for 2 weeks and said to keep taking my famotidine. If after 2 weeks it isn’t enough he will keep me on the pantoprazole for a 2 month treatment and then back to famotidine only.

He said that pantoprazole interferes with calcium absorption so it can contribute to or worsen osteoporosis if you are on it long term. (I think year) My mom is and he basically said to have her check in with her doctor about her symptoms and options. He also said that sometimes we just have to choose the best option we have and GERD can lead to Barrett's esophagus which HAS to be treated because it can lead to esophageal cancer if it is left untreated. I’m so sorry some of you are dealing with that condition too. Keep taking good care of yourselves everyone!💕

And with RA my rheumatologist told me it HAS to be treated or it could eventually lead to organ damage etc. so yeah. I guess we all have to choose our best options. Even if our options are limited…

What do you know about sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)?,comment,"Thank you. I think because it can be such a debilitating disease that has flares, periods of remissions, and is so variable in severity for people , well meaning people attribute remission to things like diet to feel some sense of control for themselves. And others want to be helpful and hopeful for people they know and love. Because there aren’t studies on diet affecting it as well, you can’t prove it *doesn’t* work. But for me, because there aren’t studies and it can become debilitating and deadly even, it’s not worth putting my faith in something unproven over something that has been proven helpful. Even if the side effects of medication can be difficult to deal with.

Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,post,"Can anyone help me please. I am being told to start Anti tnf treatment for RA. 

I am currently on hydroxychloroquine twice daily. It helps but i have flare ups alot and the fatigue is a killer. I also have emotionally unstable personality disorder and complex ptsd. 

My body and mind works against me everyday. I work and raise two children. I have tried dmards but i am now running out of options as you all know all these meds carry a risk. 

I do not have any joint deformity and low levels of swelling my crp and esr are basically normal now. 

However flaring everyday,every thing is a struggle. 

I am not even sure that i need to be on anti tnf. The issue is you only get 10 mins once a year with a dr. 

I have briefly tried methotrexate but my hair started falling out so i stopped. 

I have scared myself silly with all these bigger drugs due to the risks of sepsis and certain cancers etc",3,154xrcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/154xrcd/terrified_of_going_on_anti_tnf_treatment_for_ra/,1689874940
Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,comment,"Please consider what rheumatoid arthritis does to your body without the drugs, too. I was diagnosed just prior to the earliest biologics, Humira and Enbrel came on the market, or if they were available, the doctors weren't using them much yet, at least where I live. So my choices were the DMARDS methotrexate (mtx), leflounomide, sulfasalazine, plaquanil, and rarely used gold injections. Yup, you read that right, gold injected into sick people.

At that time I was a hair stylist (another thing RA took from me) and one of my clients was a dementia nurse, and she was adamantly against mtx, told me it was poison, don't ever let them give it to me. She was incorrect, though. Methotrexate has turned out to be the best drug for me. It makes my biologic work better, and my liver labs are right where my doctor wants them. I've been on it for about 12 years now. It has outlasted a few JAK inhibitors, and now I'm taking Orencia with it since 2021, and also plaquanilall along too. So please don't listen exclusively to the doom and gloom about these drugs. They are what makes it possible for me and many others all around the globe to live a semblance of a normal life. Rheumatoid arthritis has taken so much from me, and had I not given in and agreed to try the meds, I would be even worse off now than I am.",7,jstqa0x,,1689913267

I've been on Methotrexate for a couple of months now, and it seems to have reduced the flare ups to about once a month. But I can relate to the feelings of the original poster - my Dr just put me on Xeljanz XR and I'm too terrified to take it. In an FDA study two years ago one of the doctors involved in the research said he wouldn't hesitate to give it to a healthy 50 year old - but would not give it to a 70 year old with heart or lung disease. I'm 69 yrs old, with both heart and lung disease (3 heart attacks, 4 heart operations, COPD).

Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,comment,"IMO anti-tnf's are a modern miracle of science. It blows my mind how the scientists patch together those protiens. Sure, I take them because they work, but also out of pure admiration that such a molecule could even exist. I mean, wow, this is some real futuristic stuff! I doubt anyone even could fathom something like this 100 years ago.

My reasoning is that if biotech spends that much $ on compounds that are so specific to many autoimmune diseases, have been around for 30 years, and are still prescribed, the safety profile is going to be much better than other less-effective drugs.

Terrified of going on Anti tnf treatment for RA,comment,"I’ve been on multiple anti-TNFs starting about 9 years now and they were like a miracle drug for me, working within 2 weeks of starting treatment. 

Don’t worry about the risks, your doctor wouldn’t suggest it unless the risks and benefits had been collectively considered by the wider medical community.

Haven’t heard anything about anti-TNFs being carcinogenic either. I imagine the risk of sepsis comes from breaking the skin which is something that happens in everyday life regardless and very unlikely to progress all the way to sepsis.

And on your symptoms being mild right now, that’s great and I’m happy to hear that but these drugs are preventative as well as reactive - it’ll keep you well for longer. Often in my experience waiting to the point where you feel like you need it is already too late.

big hugs to you. it’s so hard to be young and find out you have a chronic illness. my best advice is start adjusting your life now - there’s no shame in asking for accommodations at school or work, asking your friends and loved ones to help adjust plans to be more accessible for you. find where you’re struggling and adapt - a shower chair, a mobility aid, etc can make a world of difference. 

there is hope. being young means the science will only continue to improve as we grow older with this disease. it’s so fucking hard and sometimes it sucks to have to be brave when you don’t want to be. but there are people out there who get it. 
i’ve ended up seeking therapy to help me through the grief of coping with the diagnosis. we’re framing it as grief counseling so i can productively mourn the life i envisioned for myself, what i’m losing, but also adjust how i’m moving forward and planning my future.

"Those of you who were diagnosed young, is there any hope?",comment,"I was diagnosed at 5 years old. I’m 26 and in remission now and I’m on social security disability pay (essentially medically retired). I don’t take any meds other than pain meds when I need them. 

I remember taking methotrexate and arava when I was younger, I think the meds helped. I was really stiff in the morning. Now it just hurts to stand for along time. I have high arches and hammer toes. 

I also have DiGeorge’s Syndrome partial deletion of 22q11.2 with no heart problems, but the RA came from that.",6,jo9cjpn,,1686856078
"Those of you who were diagnosed young, is there any hope?",comment,"I was diagnosed at 16, I was put on many medications but the only one that has helped at all is Etanercept.

If you don't have access to that, then a combination of painkillers and heat/ice can help. 

Naproxen, hydroxychloroquine and tylenol was what I found helped the most before I had my injections. 

I have a LOT of pain and stiffness every morning, so I'd recommend using an icepack as soon as you wake up. This might increase the pain but it will help quite a bit with stiffness! 

After icing my painful joints, it helps to exercise the stiff joints. For me, my hands, wrists and ankles that are the worst- so I do stretches for my legs and wrists. 

If you would like me to describe physiotherapy stretches for you with diagrams then I can provide some for you that I received from my physiotherapist! She gave me quite a few for many joints :)

As for my fingers I like to squeeze thick slime. You should be able to find some in walmart/target,  playdough slime works pretty well. 

The whole exercise process is pretty painful but it gets easier as it goes on, and after a while I have mostly full movement back.

Keep moving and doing small exercises throughout the day otherwise you could stiffen up again, exercise is your best friend.

I find that having a heatpack mid day and in the evening can help with pain, but dont put it directly onto your joints as it can promote swelling!! 


Good luck!!!! 

TLDR; 
Etanercept, Naproxen, Hydroxychloroquine and Tylenol.

Heat/Ice Packs

I developed it really young and since I couldn’t communicate, it was dependent on my family to notice. Luckily they noticed very early on before a lot of problems could set in. I’ve been through a large handful of different medications. It gets better. I still have RA and I’m almost 21. I work in a physical job where I use my joints all day. I’m on remicade which is a biologic and I have been since I was twelve and for me it works very well. I get it every 4 weeks through an iv.

I could barely walk, couldn't lift a fork up to my mouth to eat, I couldn't stay awake throughout the day. Now I can function a lot better. If I overdo it I still flare, but still not as bad. Now I'm struggling to get enough sleep since now I'm able to actually do things (and general life stressors). I recommend eating healthy as you can, getting sleep, and exercising within limits. I've found success eating less processed foods, less peppers, less dairy. My doctor recommended eating a Mediterranean diet as well and when I'm able to stick to it it helps.

I was TERRIFIED to start MTX, even though I’ve known for a long time that it would probably be inevitable for me eventually. It’s scary, but really only because you hear of the worst side effects SOME people have and hear it called chemotherapy. Side effects all depend on the person taking it. It doesn’t give me bad side effects at all. (Past the first couple weeks) Some people, it does. Just listen to your body and keep in touch with your doctor.

Hydroxychloroquine is a common place to start and adding mtx usually follows.  If it doesn’t provide a lot of relief, you can change to a biologic.  The mtx is probably going to help significantly.

after 50yrs on this RA crazy train my problems now are damage from the years where I had no effective medication and osteoarthritis and bone density issues because of prednisone being the main medication to keep the joints moving so I could get through basic daily tasks. 
Even the joint replacements and advances in technology with less invasive surgery research into regrowing the cartilage etc. is reason to have hope.

I was then told to take 2.5mg and taper down but it was a bit too hard as I’d become stiff (nothing too severe though).

Just a rough day...,post,"Apologies for the vent...

It's only been 4 months since my official diagnosis and I feel like I just keep getting worse and worse. It's so hard to tell how much of this is in my head and how much of it is real. I'm taking hydroxychloroquine daily, but still taking my usual Aleve 2-3 times a week and using a heating pad daily.

I've been trying to do all the right things. I've been working on eating healthier. Cut way back on alcohol and sweets, cooking most of my meals and focusing on whole foods, etc. I've been trying to do some (very short/gentle) yoga in the morning a few days a week and do more walking throughout the week. I'm forcing myself to do my hobbies (knitting and crocheting) even when my hands feel useless so that I don't just lay around feeling sorry for myself.

But I'm just sitting here at work feeling awful. My whole body hurts. My brain is in such a fog that I'm getting nothing done. I'm so tired it's like I haven't slept even though I got 9 hours. I swear on days I do yoga I feel worse. 

I have my next appointment in 2 more months, but I don't know if I should be trying to move that up or if this is just me being depressed about the diagnosis and letting myself fall into a funk. I'm worried that it's starting to affect my work performance at a time when I really need a promotion in order to be able to continue to pay my bills.",10,164j8qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/164j8qq/just_a_rough_day/,1693317478

I remember a few months when I was hobbling towards the front door. Could barely walk and the pain was everywhere. Ibuprofen was barely helping. I got to the front door and couldn't open it, no matter how hard I tried. I looked at my roommate who was getting up to help me. I said ""I can't possibly live the rest of my life like this!"" It was a moment of raw and unfiltered anguish and despair.

I went back to my rheumatologist shortly afterwards and started a new treatment and within a couple of weeks, started to feel better.

Now my pain is much less and I have less of the crippling exhaustion and fatigue.

There are lots of different treatments and you will find the one that works for you.

Just a rough day...,comment,"Hey TeacherTish, it sounds like you're doing all you can at present to help yourself. I do want to mention that many people with chronic pain and illness are prone to experiencing depression. It's not something one can keep oneself from falling into but more a matter of just having more to deal with more than is humanly possible to handle. You may want to consider seeing your PCP to be evaluated for depression and possible medication to help.

It's really hard and it sounds to me like you need a break. I do too and unfortunately we can't get that. I'm not going to tell you everything's going to get better because that isn't something anyone can guarantee.

That said, keep your head up. Most RA treatments can take up to 6 months to start working. You're still new in the journey and all meds don't work for everyone. It takes some trial and error to get the right combination. If yours hasn't shown any improvement now it might be the wrong option or it might be that this med isn't a good fit. If you're really struggling, move up your appointment 100%. It doesn't have to be unbearable.

Side note, I had really bad depression on some meds, could yours maybe be influencibg you similarly? Regular chloroquine for example made me feel so dull and hollow that I could barely get out of bed and prednisone makes me a little sensitive.

It’s hard enough living with this pain. I can’t kill myself trying to live better. I’m planning to do that once my pain is more in control. Do what comes easy to you. Don’t force yourself.

As far as yoga, I have friends who swore how great yoga is and that I should try it. So, I tried chair yoga were I was the youngest in the class.

Also, maybe reach out to your rheumy and share this. They might have some ideas to alleviate some pain. You also really need to get some decent sleep!  It's so important for healing, and RA puts us in constant need of healing. Here's an article about how not getting enough [sleep ](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Mood-and-sleep) can cause brain fog and negative emotions. We already deal with RA brain fog and emotional baggage. You don't need more! Your rheumy should be able to help with that, too. 
Also, I've been told by more than one physician that if something hurts, don't force yourself to do it. I understand wanting to DO something to make yourself feel better, but right now you need to be gentle with yourself.

Prednisone turns my into a different person and not in a good way, but I do have another prescription NSAID I can take. I'm hesitant to take it too frequently, but will try to get more details at my next appointment about how often I can/should take.",1,jybgxvn,,1693360297
Just a rough day...,comment,"I can’t imagine how you are managing without prednisone or NSAIDs. Predisone does take some time to get used to though. Maybe give it another shot. I find naproxen very effective at 500-1000mg a day. A few weeks should be okay and then you’d need to take an antacid with it. Uncontrolled inflammation causes a lot of damage, so do try the meds. Yeah I’m doing a lot of cereal and sandwiches too. Whatever is easy. Housework is rough on RA Joints. Call your brother to help. You’re under a lot of stress. I find myself breaking down when I overdo things and am in tears. You don’t know how much pain you are in till you get some relief. I’d said 7 at mg first appointment, now I wonder how was I functioning. I was at 9-10!! I was crying everyday but I still thought I’m doing okay. I wasn’t. Was getting increasingly depressed. I hope you are able to find what works best for you. Be kind to yourself:)",2,jyc6r2r,,1693373868

RA Pain in Wrist,post,"I've been diagnosed with RA now for 6 months. I'm taking Hydroxychloroquine daily and I think it's helped a little. Recently I've been having such terrible pain when bending my left wrist. It feels like my wrist is permanently sprained?  I now need to wear a wrist support to stop by wrist from bending otherwise I get a super sharp pain. Has anyone ever experienced this? For context, I work from home, typing all day, probably 12 hours a day. This is not the hand I use for my mouse.

&#x200B;

Just curious if anyone has ever experienced this.

Check with your doctor as you might be able to take Advil or Aleve to help with the pain.

I kept my wrist in splints but I'm wondering if it might have been better to try to exercise and stretch it. you might want to speak to your doctor about that.

My mom’s physical therapist friend recommends I do hand exercises and had my mom buy these exercise balls I’m supposed to squeeze.

Anyone become intolerant to some foods?,post,"Hello everyone: I’ve recently been diagnosed with Seronegative RA. I’ve been put on Hydroxychloroquin and predisone for the 3-4 weeks. I’ve noticed I’ve become intolerant to a lot of foods I used to have regularly all my life- seems to be related to some spices. Been getting worse since April when I got the runs from routine food. In the last month, even less spicy food is burning my throat and causing diarrhoea within an hour of eating. I even asked other people who were eating if they felt the burning too, and they didn’t because it was low spice. I’ve also noticed am not able to introduce anything new into my diet. Is this related to RA flare or side effect of my meds?

Dry eyes?,post," A few years ago, I was watching TV with a friend and there was a commercial for Restasis. I totally made fun of it. A prescription for *dry eyes*? Ridiculous! 
For the past few years I have been using a lot of eye drops. I brushed it off as allergies, side effects from neuro meds, or just one of the joys of aging. 
This past January I was at my optometrist for my Plaquinel/ hydroxychloroquine check up, and she put me on Restasis. It took several weeks to start working, but I am floored at how different - and better!! - my eyes feel. I didn't even realize how uncomfortable they were.
Imagine my surprise to learn that Restasis is, at it's core, an anti-inflammatory drug. According to the Arthritis Foundation dry eyes are common among people with autoimmune issues (RA, Sjogren's, lupus). ""The same autoantibodies that attack your joints can target your eyes, preventing normal tear production"". 
So, get your eyes checked! Especially if you are experiencing tired, sore, or dry eyes.
EDIT: like so many of our meds Restasis is pricey. Here's how I get mine [abbvie assist Restasis ](https://www.abbvie.com/patients/patient-support/patient-assistance/eligibility-criteria.html)",15,15574j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/15574j9/dry_eyes/,1689896293

Finding the right biologic,post,"For some background; I've been treated for undifferentiated connective tissue disorder for 20 years, I'm now 43.  I had. Long remission after getting pregnant at 35 until I got covid in 2020. Full disclosure, I am an RN in acute care. I went back on hydroxychloroquine with my post covid flair (the irony was not lost on me.)
I did fine for about a year and the flairs got more common requiring multiple steroid tapers without relief so I was started on Humira (failed mtx and arava years ago) after recheck of my RF came back just under 400.  It helped for a bit, but then I started having breakthrough symptoms between biweekly injections and insurance wouldn't pay for weekly humira as I don't have an official RA diagnosis (though my doc says I'm ""getting closer"") so now I'm starting enbrel.  I also take a rx dose of naproxen and I am prescribed prn steroids.  I have been trying not to rely on the Prednisone but I can't make a fist in the morning, I have trouble doing basic self care, and now the pain and stiffness is becoming worse in larger joines including my elbows and knees. 
I guess I'm just curious if as needed steroids are commonly prescribed for folks, is this standard practice?  I have had patients on a low daily dose chronically, but not as needed.  I realize it may take time for me to find the right meds that work, but I'm feeling quite defeated with everything I've already tried and still having so much pain and not a definitive diagnosis.

Finding the right biologic,comment,"I feel for you. I'm in my 50's, seronegative RA, uncontrolled flairs after getting Covid. But also a gradual worsening of symptoms since perimenopause. Since Covid I've been on steroids more than I have in the previous 10 years. As you may already know, it's the total lifetime dose of steroids that determines your risk of long term side effects. So if you're going thru a hopefully temporary rough period, by all means use the steroids as needed. 

There was a time during the start of my disease when my rheumatologist gently but firmly told me to decrease my as needed use because I was growing too dependent on it. Then I got disseminated Histo on Humira and steroids so I avoided steroids like the plague for 10 years. 

Since getting Covid, my doc has been generous with steroids and when I had a massive overseas vacation planned she offered an Rx of prednisone to take to guarantee I would enjoy my trip.

(P.S. since you are at that perimenopause phase, I'll add that for me, starting HRT and eventually adding testosterone Rx has helped tone down some of my inflammation.)",8,jt0ov84,,1690045860

I’m assuming you’ve had all the other tests: sed rate, anti-CCP, etc.? I would think there are other inflammation markers that are elevated. What about x-rays? Those are usually fairly definitive at helping with a diagnosis. 

I don’t have much knowledge as far as steroids go - I’ve always been told to avoid them unless absolutely necessary so that’s sort of what I’ve done. Other than lack of sleep, they really do make me feel better so it can be hard not to ask for them. I wish you much luck!",2,jt53gh5,,1690131472

Since them I'm on methotrexate, prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, folic acid, omeprazole and ibuprofen. I have to take these everyday.
My pain is better but I'm still in pain most mornings, I keep having a reoccurring side effect of lip swelling in one area and it's horrible.
My self image is damaged due to past trauma and I literally can't take it anymore. 
If its not pain, it's swelling if it's not that then I'm nauseous or depressed. I cry constantly because my self image keeps getting worse, I can't exercise because of pain.
I live in the UK and the NHS & A&E Are shit!! I'm supposed to have health check ups which I'm not getting, I'm supposed to have physio therapy which I'm not getting, I'm supposed to see my specialist often when I've only seen him twice since I was diagnosed.

The methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine and folic acid all made me feel sick and really low. Prednisone can help during a major outbreak and while you are getting other meds on board but long term use is not recommended.

Ghost pipe(monotropa uniflora) is a plant that works like a dissociative. Separates you from the pain. Take in tincture form. Also look into ibuprofen and what it does to your body. For me it's the only OTC that does anything whatsoever to RA pain, but it's super bad to take long term so I try to use it as safely as possible. Also also, ice your veins.

Did anyone else have to do 3 medications and the same time 3 months to get approved for biologics?,comment,"In Aus, with the government subsidising medication through the PBS, we have to have the rheumy apply for funding of a biologic, with criteria of having done 3 months (can't remember, maybe 4?) of the more common treatments without improvement, as well as inflammation of a certain number of major or minor joints.    
The easy explanation is that they cost so much more but PBS rules are designed by doctors so maybe there's a bit of 'try a traditional treatment with known side effects first before hitting it with the new big guns.' They also have a rule about only getting 3 attempts with different biologics if they prove ineffective.   
Sounds like your insurance has similar rules.   
Certainly when I was diagnosed it was all about methotrexate being the wonder drug, with proven efficacy over decades. It just wasn't cutting it for me so they ended up adding hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide, with prednisone all through those 6 months, before going to adalimumab (which was an immediate game changer: just looking at reducing the others slowly now, hoping to drop them.  )  
They kept saying that mtx etc take a few months to kick in sometimes so I was putting in the time waiting (but certainly got very frustrated in the absence of improvement. )

"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",post,"I've been pretty lucky, the other travel-related questions I've been reading up on here mostly have to do with pain relief, but I've been doing well enough recently that that's not my main concern, it's more about the risk of covid. I'll be going to a developing country from the US, and they don't have some of the more recent very effective treatments the US now has.

Background: I'm 37 and have had another autoimmune condition, lichen planus, for a couple of years ago, and was taking methotrexate for it, and then was diagnosed with RA and Sjogren's earlier this year when some of my joints starting hurting terribly. For all three conditions now, I *only* take 400mg of hydroxychloroquine daily, and while the dryness and thirst and itchiness and twinging joints and tiredness still aren't great, they're manageable. 

I'm also overweight and have had mild asthma since childhood, except some years back when I had pneumonia and it combined with the asthma to make it impossible to breath. But aside from that, it's been fine!

I'm more worried about what a long journey I have coming up (three different flights and stopovers adding up to about 24 hours of travel, one specific flight being a 13 hour non-stopper) and the number of people I'll be exposed to and the amount of time around them. I live alone and mostly work from home so I've been able to stay mostly isolated these last few years, and I mask up outside, and am planning to for most of the trip but I'll have to eat and I'll still be in those planes and airports with a bunch of people, mask or not.

I've tried to read up on the risk of RA and covid, but a lot of what's been said about more severe cases seems to narrow in on immunocompromised systems, especially as a result of taking certain meds, which from what I can glean, hydroxychloroquine isn't one of? But looking hydroxychloroquine and covid of course gives you just results on all those articles and studies on how effective it is at treating it after... you know. Other reports of more danger for RA patients mention having particularly bad/advanced cases which I would say I don't have?

Oh, and I've been able to get vaccinated and boostered, including the bivalent booster a couple of weeks ago.

Thanks in advance for reading this far and any insight people can offer. :)",3,yoapnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/yoapnc/how_risky_would_flying_longdistance_be_taking/,1667789528

"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",comment,"I'm a walking collection of autoimmune diseases, so I did extensive research when covid hit. If you are worried about catching Covid, traveling by airplane is the safest. The way they keep the cabin pressure is constant airflow. They have vents over every seat, so every passenger is breathing fresh air. Unless the person directly next to you is both experiencing symptoms and coughing in your face, you should be fine. The layovers inside the airport is where you will be the most exposed. If you can, upgrade your mask to n95. I get mine from projectn95.org so I know that they are legit.",4,ivew8bv,,1667829101
"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",comment,"While hydroxychloroquine does lower your immune response, it doesn't do it as drastically as, say, Humira does. I was on hydroxychloroquine for the first year of COVID and I was advised not to travel ANYWHERE because the pandemic was much more severe in 2020. But it's when I started Humira that my rheumatologist advised me to avoid airplane travel whenever possible specifically because of my RA and medication regimen. I think at my last checkup my immune response was around 20%, so even though COVID numbers are very low in my current location I still don't go anywhere where there's crowds excepting grocery stores, and I try to go shopping in the middle of the day when most people are at work. I also still wear a mask, and I plan to for the rest of my life.

I would check with your rheumatologist but honestly, like the other poster said I would be more concerned about a flare up given the stress of travel. One reason I don't plan on taking an airline trip in at least the next few years is the fact that I get so stressed out from travel through airports. I experience less stress on an 18-hour drive than I do a 2-3 hour flight because of the airport, not because of the flight itself. I guess the question is how well you travel. If you're like me and it's more of a challenge, you may find it more difficult. 

Perhaps part of the solution would be to build in a day upon your arrival where you can simply rest, whether at your hotel or whatever your accommodation is, where you don't have to go anywhere except maybe for food. One day to unpack, cope with jet lag, and sleep in a proper bed maybe enough to help you work through any flare up. And, of course, masking up for the entire trip from departure airport until you reach the final location.",3,ivdgwvs,,1667792860
"How risky would flying long-distance be, taking into account covid?",comment,"I've been on hydroxychloroquine for over 2 years. I got Covid for the first time in August and was able to get Paxlovid within the first 24 hrs. It helped me recover much faster, but the symptoms were still hell before they got better. The body/joint pain was so intense -- I honestly think that was the worst symptom for me. I couldn't get comfortable or be still because it was so bad-- it caused me a lot of mental distress because of this. Very very difficult time falling asleep (I had to take sleep meds to knock me out). Just awful. 

I've now been experiencing a long flare up ever since recovering. No new symptoms that would make me think there are new ""long COVID"" issues, but I haven't felt this bad of a flare up for this long since before I got diagnosed 😭 it really, really sucks. 

As others have said, it's technically an immunosuppressant-- but it's not doing the same suppressing of your immune system as something like methotrexate or steroids would.

Still, I can say as someone who recently went through it-- it's not a fun virus for those with health issues to deal with, even if you avoid being hospitalized. 

My advice would be to see if you can get some Paxlovid to take with you at all. It's really the only thing that helped me and I would not want to experience COVID without having some type of treatment like that available. 

When I've traveled by plane in the past year or so, I've worn an N95 mask and don't take it off for any reason. Now my flights have been 2-3 hrs, so it's a bit easier to pull off in that situation...

Possible RA,post,"Hi All- I had a baby almost 6 months ago and about 6 weeks post-partum started having excruciating joint pain in my feet, backs of heels, knees, hips, elbows, wrists, fingers, shoulders. I thought maybe it was my body readjusting but it isn’t going away. Some days are better than others. I have an aunt with RA, so I saw a rheumatologist who did blood work and X-rays and said I was negative for RA but that 30 percent of people with RA test negative. He wanted me to start on prednisone which I haven’t yet done as I’m on another medication I cannot take it with. I had an unusual pregnancy as I had 6 prior miscarriages and finally an immunologist helped to figure out my immune system viewed my pregnancies as foreign objects and attacked them & I had 5 blood clotting disorders. The solution to me finally sustaining a pregnancy was being on very intense immunosuppressants and other medications for most of my pregnancy (prednisone, tacrolimus, hydroxychloroquine, lovenox injections, IVIG, etc). I’m wondering if:
1-it’s common for people to have RA but a negative on all testing
2-if anyone has had an onset post pregnancy or is it possible it’s just taking my body a long time to regulate from all the meds and hormones?

Everyone has been sort of lax about it but I know it’s a lifelong disease that gets worse without treatment so I’m nervous. TIA!!",8,1009ldn,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/1009ldn/possible_ra/,1672539309

However, there are a lot of autoimmune disorders. Many of them cause joint pain/inflammation. Many of them are treated with the same medications. In my experience, just being diagnosed with an autoimmune response should be sufficient to start to explore adequate treatment options. Unfortunately, it often takes some trial and error to get the right treatment no matter what your diagnosis may be. I wish you the best of luck.",3,j2hbdgp,,1672558684
Possible RA,comment,"My RA also started as sero negative, but within two years of starting methotrexate and prednisone, I became sero positive. Personally, I would go with the doctor’s suggestions, but whatever you do, STAY POSITIVE!",3,j2i3whu,,1672582572
Possible RA,comment,"My symptoms started 4 months pp. I’m seropositive and my dad has RA. Post partum onset is quite common; google search will say they don’t know what causes RA but illness, trauma and hormones (aka pregnancy) are common triggers. It is still possible that you don’t have RA; only time and a good doctor can help there. Best of luck to you.",2,j2hdmjn,,1672560581
Possible RA,comment,"I started developing symptoms about 3-4 months postpartum and no one believed me for 4 years until finally 1 test came back borderline positive for autoimmune disease. Unfortunately you can start developing symptoms of the disease long before it shows up in your bloodwork. 

Consider yourself very lucky you have a doctor who acknowledges seronegative RA and takes your symptoms seriously. I had 4 to 5 doctors treat me like I was crazy before I finally pushed back and made them dig deeper until they finally found it. Once my Anti-CCP came back ridiculously high, they could not deny what I had been saying for so long. 

I hope you don't have this illness. I hope it's something else entirely that is treatable and curable. But if it is, just know what your going through is real and valid. Trauma (like a pregnancy and delivery) can activate a Dormant autoimmune condition like flipping a light switch so it's totally plausible. 

Good luck friend. Keep us posted.",2,j2lwgmh,,1672645858
Possible RA,comment,"Are you currently tapering off the meds they put you on for the pregnancy?

Because coming off them too quickly could give you RA like symptoms.",1,j2grhli,,1672545777
Possible RA,comment,"Pregnancy can mess with your body. Basically any drastic physical change or traumatic event can trigger an autoimmune disease to flare/awaken. You had your specific ANA panel run I assume. Did anything else show a positive factor? What was your ANA? CRP? There are other determining factors and I worry that not enough tests are being done for you.

Plaquenil is a med given for non-specified autoimmune issues (as well as diagnosed ones) with a high ANA so you’re already on one med you might be prescribed. Both of my daughters have autoimmune issues and have positive markers for a few. It’s crappy as they’re 7 and 10. My 10 y/o has been on Plaquenil for a year already and it seems to be keeping her in check this far.

So, yes, pregnancy (delivery and post-partum) can activate a lot of latent things in your body. I’d suggest keeping a journal of symptoms, changes, etc. it’s helpful when trying to be diagnosed to present it so that it can be tracked over time. Knowing that you’re stiff in the morning and for how long, if you get hit by exhaustion around 1:30pm, where the pain is, the pain level over time, etc., is really helpful for a good rheumatologist.",1,j2hzi0v,,1672579780
Possible RA,comment,"I developed RA postpartum, and it is seronegative. I believe I was around 4 months PP- same idea as you re: the pain in backs of heels, hips, wrists, fingers and very intense costochondritis. My hand ultrasound and MRI were both clean (MRI of hips and spine did show some cysts, a labrum tear, and some spinal arthritis) and the first rheumatologist felt I possibly had some inflammatory arthritis but wasn’t sure what it was at that time (my mom had psoriasis so she thought potentially psoriatic arthritis despite never having had psoriasis myself). I wasn’t improving on the meds she prescribed (methotrexate oral and prednisone tapers which did help slightly but I’d crash later) so she discharged me, and I sought a second opinion which was confirmed by having 8 actively inflamed joints. Mostly all of my bloodwork was normal: negative anti CCP, negative RF, slightly elevated CRP and ESR, positive ANA, and elevated igB. I had a nerve conduction study and they also confirmed that I had neuropathy related to disease activity, and once I started on biologics that thankfully went away. I wish you luck and I hope you can get some answers; being a new parent after struggling to conceive and feeling awful every day is such a challenging journey 💕",1,j2igwd3,,1672589267
Possible RA,comment,"Thank you for this response! I didn’t realize the term was seronegative, or that it wasn’t commonly recognized! That’s crazy.

Possible RA,comment,"Thank you for all this advice, it’s very helpful. Yes I was negative for all the tests. However, my reproductive immunologist regularly ran ANA and a bunch of tests that included things like igB and other “igs”. Some of those were sometimes borderline but I didn’t have joint pain then so was just looking at it through the lens of infertility issues, I’ll have to go back and look.

I’m sorry your daughters have to deal with this. I have a lot to learn about it assuming that is what I’m dealing with - everything I have read so far sounds like what I’m experiencing. It’s good to know it is manageable. I didn’t have any negative reactions/side effects to plaquenil when I was taking it for fertility issues so maybe that’s an option.

How did your hydroxychloroquine stomach issues manifest? And a little rant…,post,"First time posting in this community that has become my lifeline recently ❤️. 

TLDR, I am in the throes right now and feeling way too sorry for myself - think I may be having a bad reaction to HQN but not sure where to place the blame. 

I’m seropositive, 36F, and finally got myself on the medication train after a bout of denial/fear and a bad experience with MTX. I started hydroxychloroquine almost a month ago, plus a run of prednisone because I was in such a bad flare. The first few days I had the common HQN diarrhea issues but then it calmed down. Now I’m at the end of a trip with my husband/family to Europe right now (obviously very lucky). It’s my first time really traveling with active disease, and it started off ok until I had to start tapering of the pred and then got hit with Covid. I’ve been isolating from everyone and in bed with a fever for 4 days, but the last few days I’ve also developed GI issues like I haven’t had in many years, and also some minor rashes and itching. Anything I eat goes straight through me, no matter what it is. I’ve heard issues with this drug can show up on a delay and was wondering if anyone has a similar experience... 

I will definitely talk to my doctor about this when I get home - he’s just impossible to get a hold of even when we’re in the same time zone.

Edit: turns out I had E. coli and covid at the same time 🤦🏻‍♀️ back on the hydroxychloroquine and doing fine so far",9,16zy3cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16zy3cp/how_did_your_hydroxychloroquine_stomach_issues/,1696452252

Clear scans and clear bloodwork,post,"I've been on here a bit talking abt being mistreated terribly by last old rheumatologist. Last time I was much more panicked, now I'm just tired of yelling into the void that is the medical field. 

My scans (hand/foot X-rays, finger/wrist joint ultrasounds) and bloodwork (multiple ESRs, 4 CRPs, even my 1-4-33 eta) are all normal.  The only abnormalities in my inflammatory bloodwork are 2 P-ANCAs and an RF of 19 back 6 mos ago. My RF has since been within normal range. Sporadic anemia which nobody is catching except me, PIP/shoulder/toe joint pain that gets intense beginning 9 mos ago. Various debilitating myalgia & fatigue, etc etc etc, the list goes on. Oh, and my mom has MS and her mom has psoriasis. 

I have a better rheum now but she's probably gonna Dx me w fibromyalgia without trying hydroxychloroquine/metholtrexate/immune suppressant therapy first. She said immune therapy doesn't work for fibro. I'm still not convinced I don't have RA and w2ant to try immune supppressants empiracally. It's only been 9 months since my PIP/finger joint pain started (would actual degeneration show up that quickly on scans???), my family hx is fulll of autoimmune disorders, and I have intense PTSD/migraines/hypersensitivity in general. 

Obviously if I do have RA it's seronegative (which I've read up a lot on), but has anyone who is seronegative ALSO had clean scans but been helped by experimental/exploratory/pre-diagnosis immune suppressant therapy that subsequenrlty proved that you did have RA after all even with clean scans?

Honestly, I would talk to your rheumatologist about seronegative and maybe even ask for a burst of prednisone to see if it helps. Out of curiousity, is your rheumatologist younger or older? Mine is younger, 40's, and so she's all about more than bloodwork and scans - it's your symptoms and how you feel too. My scans are clean but I have very clear inflammation just looking at some of my joints. My bloodwork is decent other than a weak positive RF. But I have the pain, the stiffness, the aches, the fatigue, the swelling - I fit. It means we've been fortunate and caught it early. The earlier you're able to start medicating, the better.

Clear scans and clear bloodwork,comment,"All bloodtests are always negative for me and my doctor regularly checks them all. No positive ESR, RF, CRP or anti CCP anywhere. Hell, I don't have any odd blood work besides an occasionally low white cell count and good ole iron deficiency. The xrays and other scans they did pre diagnosis of my fibro were all clear too and I've never had them repeated since (though I probably maybe should). The only tests that ever show inflammation for me was the gallium scan and clinical inspection. Which is ironic because I have it everywhere. I didn't even know you could get inflammation in some of the places that scan picked it up. 

At the end of the day, the clinical inspection should be the final vote. If there's nothing on your tests but something that can be seen in observation you can still get a diagnosis. I know it's not what you want to hear, but if your doctor doesn't see anything on top of normal tests, RA might not be your answer. Ask for the scan and maybe a second opinion but don't try on meds like DMARDs just to see if they work.

hydroxychloroquine not effective,comment,"My intent with this comment is to offer you information and maybe even hope. You haven’t told us your full symptom list, so I have no idea how your case compares to mine, so I’m certainly not trying to say I’m worse off than you or anything like that. I just want to offer an example, and you can compare to yourself (and maybe read more people’s stories) and then decide if you want to be a stronger advocate for yourself or stick with the current plan. I think my story can also offer hope. 

>	If my condition is not severe then I don’t want to know how severe it can be.

My case is considered severe. My diagnosis was six months after my first symptom. In that time I went from a normal 16 year old girl to barely being able to walk and having to sit and scoot to go up and down stairs. If I pushed to hard my knees would buckle and I’d fall (this could happen on flat ground if I was tired or just stepped wrong). I couldn’t lift my arms above my head. The joints in my shoulders just couldn’t handle it, they’d buckle. Sure, they hurt, but I can push through a lot of pain. But the joints just failed. I also struggled to chew solid foods because of the RA in my TMJ. I lost 16% of my body weight in this time, and I started on the low side of healthy, because I just couldn’t eat. I also had a trigger finger, which was the least difficult problem my RA caused. I had rheumatoid nodules as well. My list of affected joints was knees, ankles, multiple joints in my feet and toes, elbows, shoulders, wrists, fingers (pretty much all of them). Since diagnosis hips and where my ribs meet my sternum have added on. 

Both my PCP and the rheumatologist he sent me to believed I had a risk of my immune system attacking my pericardium or pleural membrane. These can become fatal. 

By the doctors’ and nurses’ behaviors I was far from the most severe they’ve seen. Definitely severe, not the most severe. 

The rheumatologist immediately started me on methotrexate. When this didn’t do much he kept escalating the dose. Eventually it stopped further progression of symptoms but no reduction of pain. So he started me on Remicade. I showed significant improvement. After getting dosing sorted I still have pain and some issues, but I seem mostly normal. It took about four years to get the meds sorted. But now I do things like race cars, ride horses, run triathlons, raise cattle (longhorns), knit, cook, bake, and more. I do more weird, different, and active things than most people without RA. 

So give the medications time. Work with your docs. Be as honest and direct with them as you can be. And take care of your full body health as best you can - being healthy helps make the symptoms less difficult to manage. I hope you find the right meds for you and can find a normalcy that works for you.",7,iv5flzf,,1667654682

I feel my legs is getting weaker, that was the first sign for me something is wrong. I get pain relief from voltaren and paracetamol. When I flare up painkillers won't work at all. Like last night, I couldn't sleep of the pain in hips and the painkillers was useless, I have nodules on my index and ring fingers and then my left elbow, and now also both my knees looks disformed. I'm getting worse but hopefully when the medicine kicks in I will get better.",2,iv5i97i,,1667656045
hydroxychloroquine not effective,comment,"Your legs buckling under you is really disturbing, isn’t it?

Topical gels do nothing for me, either. Paracetamol does help a bit, but no much. If I take 800mg ibuprofen (the max dose) it helps a little bit, but just a bit. I have methylprednisolone that I take as needed, but it has a lot of significant side effects so it’s important to understand it and take it the right way (my doc’s given me lots of coaching on it). 

It sounds like you definitely are suffering and need good care. You know what’s up with yourself, though, so it sounds like you’ll be able to work with your doc to sort things out. RA management is definitely a long term thing, and it’s really tough at first. We’re so used to medications that work in hours, like decongestants, that this, “We’ll see in 6 months,” is hard.

And it's difficult coping because I'm used to do my own thing, but now I'm dependant on someone doing mundane everyday things which is hard to accept bcause you know you can do it but your body is failing you.

I've just been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and things are really confusing to me,post,"
6 months ago I was diagnosed with hashimoto's thyroiditis which is an autoimmune system disorder, so it wasn't a surprise when I was diagnosed with RA 2 weeks ago with RA. There's no (known) history of autoimmune system disorders in my family. The doctor prescribed hydroxychloroquine, calcium and methotrexate injections (weekly injection). I had an ultrasound of my knees and hands, which showed minor effusion in my knees and minor inflammation /effusion in my fingers and wrists. It's been 3 weeks and I haven't noticed any improvement in my symptoms if bot worse. My knees, wrists and toes (the joints between my foot and toes not all the knuckles) hurt all day everyday but especially in the morning. I've noticed somethings that I don't know if they're normal with RA or not. If I sit down with my feet touching the floor, my knees pain greatly  increases within 30 minutes. Also, If I carry the lightest bag for like 5 minutes,I wake up the next morning with elbow pain that continues for 3 days. The top side of my foot hurts when I step on it or move my toes,which is also at it's peak in the morning. My doctor aaid RA only affects small joints like in your hands, otherwise RA is not the reason.

These occipital neuralgia headaches are so debilitating,post,"Just got diagnosed with RA Feb 23rd after two years of pain with no answer, so I am actually very happy about getting an answer and starting medication.

The most debilitating symptom that I cannot deal with is the chronic neck pain and tension that has led to occipital neuralgia (compression of the occipital nerves at the base of the skull). These headaches leave me sweating, shaking, nauseous/puking, dizzy, crying, and unable to leave my bed all day. They only go away with excedrin extra strength which doesn’t even work sometimes.

I saw a neurologist as a recommendation by my rheumatologist before diagnosing me with RA. neurologist said the headaches are from super tight neck muscles and compression of the nerves. She gave me numbing injections and I also had just started meloxicam so the headaches went away temporarily

I’m no longer on meloxicam, I was on it from Jan 23 to Feb 23. I finished a week long pack of  prednisone  about a week ago (because I was having the headaches) and now the headaches are back. I had one today and I’m scared of when the next one will come. 

Sorry for the long post, I’m just frustrated and it’s nice to have a place where other people understand",15,11ux093,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/11ux093/these_occipital_neuralgia_headaches_are_so/,1679166495

These occipital neuralgia headaches are so debilitating,comment,"Sorry to bear possible bad news but you may need to try a few medications to find the right one.

If it's the neck muscles causing the nerve pain then I'd try to address the muscles directly as well as through medication.

I was just diagnosed with seronegative RA and my doctor is having me start on Meloxicam and Hydroxychloroquine.

"26F, just diagnosed. What can I expect?",comment,"RA is really hard to predict, some people go into long periods of remission, for some it takes awhile to find the medication that works well for them. I have seronegative RA,  and have had to switch up meds a number of times. I am doing well, but I wouldn't say I'm in remission. Even though I have some pain, my joints are still pretty clear of degeneration. Any one else on this subReddit would have their own experiences. It is upsetting news, and does cause a lot of anxiety about the future.  But, the meds available to us are really good. Sometimes it takes awhile to get the right one, you may find a good one then it stops working for you and you have to make a change. You may notice you have triggers that can send you into a flare up -  alcohol, too much processed food, stress, not enough sleep, a sudden change in the weather. It varies from person to person. The best thing you can do is control what you can - take your meds, eat healthy, rest when you need to, find a form of exercise that helps but doesn't stress your joints. As time goes on you will figure out what works best for you. Make sure you feel comfortable with your Rheumatologist and they listen to you. Ask a million questions, read postings on this subReddit for info. Be prepared for most other people to not understand what RA is or what you are going through. Seek support where you can. Best of luck❤️.",17,j1kwxx2,,1671944519
"26F, just diagnosed. What can I expect?",comment,"It's pretty upsetting. 

Seronegative is harder to treat than Seropositive and we often have different symptoms, as well. And we generally have more inflammation and disease activity. It's incredibly important to stay on treatment, when you experience a Flare that lasts more than a few days - get in to an Urgent Care or PCP to get treatment for it. If you are having more than one Flare every three months, you report that to your rheumy. 

Understand that it's likely going to take a few treatment options, including multiple medications taken at once, before you find what works for you. And even then, as the years progress you'll likely need to switch up a bit. Additionally, seronegative can develop into seropositive, though that's not very common. 

Unfortunately, there's no way to predict long term outcomes. Stay on treatment! Even a month of treatment delay has shown considerably worse outcomes after 2 years.",5,j1m8zse,,1671982501
"26F, just diagnosed. What can I expect?",comment,"19f diagnosed earlier this year, I think you just need to plan that there are going to be a ton of times you won’t be able yo do anything, I’ve been trying to work on my diet, no gluten,dairy, processed foods, processed sugar, and I try to eat mostly organic. My best advice is to try to figure out which foods cause flares for you most often and take them out of your diet, but also to keep a lot of prepared foods you know are safe for you on hand, freeze portions of meals in the freezer and meal prep. Because there’s going to be so many times you’ll be unable to cook for yourself and if you end up ordering food you’ll just get stuck in the cycle of ordering because you feel bad and then feeling bad because of what you ordered (depending on your dietary restrictions), I’d also say that you should always try to have a back up plan when your meeting up with friends, family, an so because there’s gonna be times when you won’t feel well enough to be walking around or standing for a long period of time, I live in Florida so I always use the beach as my default because I can just sit in a chair and relax and swim if I’m up for it which always helps the joints. But I’ve also noticed that RA is a pretty good thing to have weeding out the shitty friends and people from your life, I mean the person I was with at the time of my diagnosis broke up with me because they didn’t wanna be with someone who’s sick my current gf woke up in the middle of the night last night to help me get pain pills and feel comfortable.

What I learned is even a tiny bit of trigger food can cause problem. Although Gluten foods are the most common, trigger food can be anything for an individual. The flare may not be immediate but may take 2 to 3 days after the trigger and go away 2 to 5 days after the onset of pain when the trigger food is eliminated.

Each week the intensity of the side affects has decreased. This past dose I had no fatigue. I did have some hair loss in the beginning but I switched to a different shampoo and chopped off the dead hair and it seems to have lessened. I’ve had much worse reactions to hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine. I think it won’t hurt to try it, and if it doesn’t work out you can go to something else. None of the side effects I’ve heard are possible are permanent and should dissipate after you quit the meds. And that’s worse case scenario. Best case - you get your life back.

The MTX pills contain lactose, so this is thought to contribute to the nightmarish gastrointestinal side effects that others have experienced. I have taken Lactaid with each dose so far and have had mild nausea here and there along with some gas, but that's it. I also have a pretty sensitive stomach. I can't take Tylenol without having eaten first unless I want to throw up. I lost weight when I was pregnant because I couldn't get a handle on my nausea.

The side effects have gotten more intense for me over the past 2 years. It could be partially because it's an injection and I loathe it. But the smell of alcohol wipes makes me nauseous. It screws with my PVCs for 2 days after, and makes me feel pretty ill.

I continued to get these flare ups where I have sever fatigue, my body feels incredibly stiff, I fall more easily, less mobility, headaches/migraines, nausea and vomiting and just an over all feeling of having the flu which lasts anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks. I felt like I was told I have fibro and to eat well, exercise and live a ""healthy lifestyle"". I was referred back to the rheumatologist a year later after asking my doctor about pain management again. She did an ultrasound again on my hands and said this time there appear to be signs of inflamation and had me do 2 weeks on prednisone to see how I respond to it and I felt a lot better (reduced stiffness, less fatigue, ability to keep up with my work day). She then diagnosed me with sero negative RA and when I asked if she thinks I still have fibro she said it's likely secondary and that the RA is primary. She started me on hydroxychloroquine and slowly is tapering me off the prednisone. 

It's been about a month and I feel confused as to what is RA and what is fibro but more what I should be doing to manage. I recently changed jobs and work full time in health care and I'm trying to figure out what I need to maintain my health and show up fully in my work. My work place is supportive and I do have some flexibility, it's just hard to know what I need in order to ask for it. 

Would be happy to hear from others either have fibro or who have similar symptoms as well as folks who are trying to advocate for what they need to be successful in their workplace.",6,10js3ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/10js3ji/fibro_ra_managing_health_in_the_workplace/,1674519466

Things to help balance work and life:
- Sleep is very important and naps as needed 
- Ask for help when you need it, let close people know what you’re going through. Don’t disclose to people who might use it against you. 
- Build your healthcare team. Primary doctor, rheumatologist, therapist, physical therapist, and others. Do not settle for professionals who are unwilling to be work with you with a positive mindset. You are in control of your health. 
- move your body when you are able. Gentle stretching, yoga, and other low impact movement. 
- drink water and do your best to eat healthy. 
- be easy on yourself 
- reduce stress 
- use this subreddit for support 
- try to avoid googling bad resources that not research based.

Week 2 on meds,post,"Hello everyone 

Back again 😄


Around 2 weeks ago I had my rheumatologist face to face 

After the checks and bloods, X-rays and a steroid injection 

I was given hydroxychloroquine 200mg to take once a day 

First 3 days i forgot I had rheumatoid arthritis and was so happy thinking I’m on the way to be cured 

But then these last few days, the pains have come back (not as severe as they were before medication) and my mood is horrible, random anxiety, depression and just feeling low and also shortness of breath randomly, like I walk up and down the stairs and I find it hard to catch my breath for a few minutes 

Is this RA? Or side effects of medication?

Hydroxychloroquine and nausea?,post,"Diagnosed November 2022 with seronegative RA and I'm FINALLY making some headway with my treatment and have been having some actual good days the past 3 weeks (It's been amazing!!) but I've had this terrible low grade nausea all day that started shortly after we changed my treatment plan. It just makes food very off putting and I don't really want to eat. 
The latest changes to my meds are changing MTX to injectable 25mg/week and we added on hydroxychloroquine 300 mg taken in the evening with food.

EDIT: I found out why. I am currently with Kaiser & apparently they slipped a line into the contract that said I have to get my meds through their approved pharmacies.

So now i have to change over all my prescriptions (a very clunky online form for each medication) to their mail order pharmacy.

Med cost increase?,comment," I'd call your insurance company and see what's going on-- as nothing should change with your coverage during the year. 

Did they fill the brand name instead of generic? That could also be a factor.

Do not stop taking your medication without the supervision of your doctor. 

Supplements and diet do not prevent RA from damaging your body, so I do not recommend abandoning all disease modifying drugs in lieu of ""natural"" methods.

RA is a result of your immune system misfiring and attacking your own body. There is no cure, only medication advances that have helped to slow this damage.

My great-grandmother died from RA, because there was no treatment available at that time. 

We are lucky to live in a time where we have treatment options. 

If you have any issue with your med (cost, side effects, etc), you should always have a conversation with your doctor about your options. Don't stop medication on your own.",5,ju1dpua,,1690693755

I'm hitting the 4 month mark on an enbrel trial and it's like my pain has not changed at all, if anything it's gotten worse.

The only thing you don't want to do is stop trying. That is when you will get into trouble. I refused drugs for about the first 10 years after diagnosis, which was easy at the time because I had a stealth disease in the early days. My rheumatoid was only found when I had a foot x-ray because I thought it was broken, and they found bone erosions. They told me RA is the only thing that does that. When I finally had symptoms after 10 years, I went on Enbrel, which was good for about 6 years, and my biologic use has been like that ever since. Except I added 25 mg. methotrexate injection weekly about 10 years ago, and that makes all of my meds work better. 

My doctor hasn't used labs for inflammation markers. It's all on patient reported results, and she will take x-rays of hands or feet if there are questions.

It was really bad, because of the inmune reaction, my knees got all swollen together with the joints of my upper limbs, my mom had to help me to change clothes because it hurted a lot to move on my own.

Oral corticosteroids.

Methotrexate.

Could this be RA?,post,"Hi all, 

I'm at a loss with my symptoms and hoping for some insight.

I was diagnosed with uveitis in January and have had 2 episodes to date. I have also had recurrent scleritis in my left eye since March-ish, pretty much ongoing with intermittent improvement with prednisone (on my third taper). Chronic dry eyes. For about a month when I first got really sick I could not cry or make tears out of my left eye at all.

I've had random swollen joints, mostly knees and hands but have had ankles and feet as well. I wake up with crazy stiffness every morning that lasts about 1.5 hours. I have muscle pain as well. I also have raynaud's and livedo reticularis. 

I've had sores in my mouth pop up when other symptoms flare. I have geographic tongue diagnosed by an oral pathologist. My right ear feels full and plugged and causes hearing loss whenever I go off prednisone. 

Some low grade fevers. Exhaustion, weakness dizziness, tachycardia, high BP, nausea, and constipation symptoms all flare up when off prednisone. I've had hair loss. I have had had weird blood pooling in my feet and facial flushing.

My bloodwork shows next to nothing. I have a low positive ANA (1:80 speckled) and have had high ESR and CRP during flares. I've also had high platelets, low WBC, and RBC in my urine. Mild anemia but no iron deficiency. Negative RF. Negative ENA panel. My rheum is testing anti-CCP and ANCA next. 

He initially thought I had sjogrens and put me on hydroxychloroquine 4 months ago. I had a lip biopsy which was negative so he took me off the HCQ 3 days ago because he said ""it won't do anything"" because he doesn't think I have a connective tissue disorder. 

I'm at a loss. My ophthalmologist says she can't do anything more for the scleritis because it has to be managed with systemic treatment which my rheum needs to deal with. I'm only on 10mg of prednisone and tapering for the next 8 weeks, and now no HCQ. I said I thought I had been helping with the livedo reticularis and dry eyes but he doesn't care and doesn't listen to me. 

Does this look like it could be RA? By my own googling it seems like the CCP test is to rule out RA which he obviously doesn't think I have if he took me off the HCQ. I feel like if those tests are negative he will just send me back to my family doctor. I'm just devastated. I started crying in his office because I have been sick for 9 months and he dismisses essentially all of my symptoms.

Sorry this is so long. Just looking for answers. I'm only 30 with a young child and I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore.",1,16o4snb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/16o4snb,1695265564

When the swelling is really bad i can feel and see my left eye protruding more than my right. I have also had double vision when it gets to this point. 

I was started initially on 50mg prednisone which I'd say was 80% effective with respect to the pain. The dose keeps getting lowered every taper though because my rheum doesn't want me on prednisone due to the side effects. He said if it keeps coming back I might need an immunosuppressant. I've tapered to 10mg from 20mg this round and I still need to take advil and tylenol every day for the pain. It's helped a little but its definitely not a high enough dose.",1,k1p4pza,,1695381815

Since this post my ophthalmologist has put me on 12mg of prednisone daily (no taper) for the scleritis, which barely controls it, but seems to keep my other systemic symptoms at bay for the most part. I am seeing my rheum next week and starting immunosuppressants - not sure which drug yet. He does not seem to think all of this is connected which is crazy to me. Not sure if I should ask my PCP to refer me to someone else for a second opinion or if I should just take the immunosuppressants and see what happens. I'd really like to have a diagnosis because clearly - something is not right!

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,post,"hi there! all kind responses will be much appreciated :) 

context: i (22F) have been diagnosed with RA for only about 10 months now and am currently in the process of choosing between two different advanced therapy biologic options. i have been on triple therapy of mtx, hydroxychloroquine (plaquenil), and sulfasalazine for 8 months now without seeing the greatest results (definitely less symptoms but still not symptom free, consistently and constantly struggling with pain and fatigue). i am grateful to be in a position to be able to be the one making the decision but also its a fairly big decision and it feels somewhat daunting! also i have just recently found this sub and it has been so reassuring to read other posts and to see the support that is so clearly present here; i am sure we are all too aware of how lonely this RA journey can seem so this is just really great to see/be a part of.

as i am in the process of making this decision i am trying to gain knowledge about the science side of the medications (the mechanisms of action in the body/how they work to help RA) but i am also super curious about the 'human' side of the medications (what it is like actually being on them) and hearing this from 'real' people and not just in medical/statistical jargon from clinical studies lol!

the options given to me by my rheumatologist are Cimzia (injectable TNF inhibitor) and Rinvoq (pill JAK inhibitor). the decision is ultimately mine to make at this point but he does say that he would choose the Rinvoq; yet for some reason, i just can't easily get past the fact that JAK inhibitors are relatively new and there isn't the same level/amount of long term data to study the long term effects of JAKs compared to the TNFs.

my question(s): any advice with making this decision? anyone with experience being on these medications? (good experiences and bad experiences are welcome!) how concerned do i need to be about the risks/scary side effects of medications like these? any words of encouragement to help see past the scary parts? any words of encouragement in general lol!

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,comment,"I (44F) was on methotrexate for about 3 months since my seropositive RA diagnosis in November 2022. I didn’t see significant improvement so my doctor mentioned trying Enbrel, which is a TNF inhibitor. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction. It made me break out in hives all over my back, stomach and arms. I stopped taking it and saw my doctor who then recommended Rinvoq. He said most people did extremely well on it. 

I started the medicine and felt great for the first two weeks. But then I started to feel flu-like symptoms. Within a day I had the highest fever I’ve ever had in my life. I tried to bring it down on my own but nothing worked. Decided to go to the ER and they admitted me to the hospital. As they were taking me to the room I had seizure (something that has never happened to me). I was in the hospital for 7 days total and the first 4 days they had no idea what was wrong with me. I just kept getting sicker and sicker. They had me on IVs, several broad spectrum antibiotics hoping one would work and magnesium because my blood pressure was dangerously low. Finally they tested me for strep pneumonia and did a CT scan and that came back positive. They gave me a different antibiotic and steroid shots and I finally started to feel better. I was sent home with another round of antibiotics and told I can restart the Rinvoq. 

I knew I couldn’t take it while on antibiotics or with an active infection so I waited about three weeks to take it again. I took it right after dinner and in less than 30 minutes, my face turned bright red, I developed a fever and I was shivering uncontrollably. Then the vomiting started. I had to be rushed to the ER again. I almost passed out in triage and they rushed me to a room. Basically I was in septic shock. I spent another three days in the hospital, this time in the ICU. After explaining the series of events to a multitude of doctors, the consensus was that I had a severe reaction to Rinvoq during both hospitalizations.

It has taken me months to recover. I’m just now starting to feel like myself again and getting my energy and strength back. My doctor just started me on Plaquenil, which he says is the mildest of all the medications. It’s too soon to tell if it will work. In the meantime, I have prednisone to help me deal with the joint pain. But let me tell you, building up the courage to try another medicine was tough. The mental struggle from the medical anxiety was almost as bad as the physical pain I went through. 

I know this is a negative story, and I don’t mean to scare you. But I wish I had seen stories like this when I was starting out with these new meds, especially because I had the same concern of it being a much more recent drug and possibly not studied as much. But when I asked about possible side effects, I was kind of dismissed like every drug has side effects. And while I understand that, this one almost killed me. 

Even now when I googled Rinvoq to see if others had experienced what I experienced, I couldn’t find any one who had gone through something similar. Maybe that means my experience is extremely rare and it won’t happen to you. I truly hope that’s the case. But at least you know what’s possible and to look out for any strange symptoms. I wish you the best on this journey.",6,jt39fvr,,1690092303

choosing an advanced therapy for RA,comment,"My rheumatologist also gave me the option and I chose Rinvoq because I was scared of the possible site reactions from injecting TNF inhibitors. 

I’ve been on it for 2 months now (in combination with the methotrexate that I’ve been on for 2 years) and I haven’t had any major side effects but it also doesn’t seem to be doing much. I felt great for about 2 weeks then got a UTI and even though I didn’t stop taking the Rinvoq, it’s like I just reverted back to how I was before I started it.  I’ve had a consistent mild sore throat since I’ve started taking it and it makes me tired. I take it before bed and the tiredness seems to wear off by morning. I’m a bit concerned with how quickly I got a UTI when I haven’t had one in about 20 years until now so definitely going to be watching for that…

Overall it’s not bad, but also doesn’t seem to be helping much yet. I know they say it can take 3 months to really see if it’s working, like all RA meds, so I’m staying hopeful but I have a feeling I’ll be switching to TNF inhibitors next month.",1,jt5ip2h,,1690137834

can i ask how long you were on the other medications before they started to work less well for you?

fingers crossed that if i also choose it, it will also take the edge off my fatigue as well. for me it's easier to 'suck it up' and deal with the joint pain than it is to deal with the fatigue (not that having to deal with the pain is easy by any means lol!) 

i'm not super certain of obvious benefits of the injection compared to the pill...in my opinion it seems so equal in terms of pros and cons of each; like if the injection has a con for one reason then the pill has the pro of that reason (and if the pill has a con for a reason then the injection has the pro for that reason). i think this is part of the reason that it is such a difficult decision because one option or the other doesn't stick out to me as a clear 'winner'!",1,jt682ap,,1690148411

Anyone reading this, if you get swollen, ESPECIALLY if you’re overweight, if you have a lower belly that hangs down, if you’ve had a cesarean, search manual lymphatic drainage and spend some time doing it. Hydrate first. Don’t do it before work. It’s insane. 

OP, increased food sensitivity is interesting. I spent time for a few days in a row working on my legs and that alone worked so well, it felt like I had a blockage and I opened it. I could feel a “stream” it freaked me out so bad I thought I had worms or something lmao I get tons of bloating and swelling in my stomach so last night I was working on my lower stomach and man it’s like I opened up a dam, fluid started flowing so fast and I hard I almost had a panic attack. Scared the crud out of me. 

I did notice that once you get it moving, any other areas where you might have bad posture, or any kind of disruption might hurt or feel more swollen like doing my legs made my neck hurt on one side.

Update on appointment,comment,"First, congrats on the dx! I know it's not actually a good thing, but knowledge is power. You are absolutely right that you're on the road to managing symptoms and slowing down the joint damage. These are really great things! Hydroxychloroquine/Plaquinel does take up to 6 months to get the full effect. I take it and I'm certain that it helps a lot. I am sensitive to the sun, which is a normal side effect. I have some adorable hats and SPF clothing to wear on days in the sun. But you might not have this! I'm sure others will chime in.
I've never had a shot in the bum for RA. I have had kenalog injections and they really hurt for a day or two. I put a cold pack on the site when it's really sore. Do you know what the injection was? It should be in your visit summary (either paper or on their patient portal. Call the office if you can't find it. It's important for you to know).
You are on the road to recovery 💜 For me, it's a bumpy, windy, crappy road sometimes and I'm 12+ years on. But it's still a really good thing, and we can walk that road together",6,k3q8vk6,,1696606576

He had tried different antidepressants & even antipsychotic meds for help with anxiety, depression & pain.  Could not tolerate any of them!  He has ADHD, can’t even tolerate anything for it.  He’s tried it all. 
I was on Cymbalta when it first came out & became so emotionally void, I almost drove into an oncoming semi. I also started “seeing things” that weren’t there!  My Mom was visiting & she noticed how off I was.  Thankfully!  My Dr took me off of it.

Is this really remission?,post,"I'm unsure if this post is allowed here, I'm not asking for medical advice.  I'm just curious.

I'm 23, I've had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 18 or 19 and it's been a pain, however my last rheumatologist visit resulted in my specialist saying I'm in remission - Something about a score of 2.3 = remission, I was told I have a score of 2. **At diagnosis, my rheumatoid factor was 16.4, it's currently at 16.7** (So I assume disease activity is higher currently) 

I'll admit my flare ups are very infrequent nowadays, however a short flare-up resulted in my ankle getting messed up, I assume permanently (It clicks into place and causes pain when it does this) She gave me steroids in the joint and now I'm wondering if I'm actually in remission - Does this happen often? I was on hydroxychloroquine for a while and it suddenly stopped helping.

\*When I flare up, I have really bad neck, hand and ankle/toe pains. I feel like she didn't listen to what I had to say about the flares and just wrote a letter saying I was in remission.

None of the other medicines worked for me and I'm worried it'll just get really bad one day, kind of scared. ",1,z1fyn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/z1fyn9/is_this_really_remission/,1669078826

Is this really remission?,comment,"Hi, not sure where you are based- I’m in the uk and the rheumatologist’s here use something called a DAS (Disease Activity Score) score to assess your disease activity. This is made up of: 
number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, ESR Blood result (inflammation blood marker) and a VAS score which is your answer of between 0-100, where would you put your quality of life at present. They then calculate the DAS score, which is what I presume your 2.3 score is. 
If you feel you are still having flares and your disease activity is still coming and going, definitely get in touch and ask for another appointment. There are lots of other medications to try, you just have to keep pushing. Good luck ♥️",3,ixcestf,,1669117806
Is this really remission?,comment,"Long term drug free remission is very rare. 

While RA remission is generally defined as:

one or fewer swollen joints  
one or fewer tender joints  
a patient assessment showing that on a 0–10 scale, the arthritis activity is 1 or less  
blood test results that show little or no inflammation in the levels of C-reactive protein, which is a key marker of inflammation

Starting Hadlima - advice?,post,"I was diagnosed with RA last November (I am now 36, F). I was first put on hydroxychloroquine (didn't help) and switched to injectable methotrexate in July. At my follow up appointment with my rheumatologist, he said the methotrexate wasn't working as well as he hoped (only about a 30% improvement), so we're adding Hadlima (I live in Canada, not sure how relevant that is). 
Does anyone have any advice for someone starting biologics for the first time? Do I need to be more careful about wearing a mask and protecting myself from possible illness? Or can I mostly carry on how I've been living? 
Any advice would be appreciated. This has been a tough time, getting diagnosed and trying different medications.

Edit: just to clarify, I'm asking for lifestyle advice not medical advice :)",1,yft5lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/yft5lh/starting_hadlima_advice/,1666974608
Starting Hadlima - advice?,comment,"I take Humira weekly, inject MTX, and take HCQ as well. I use common sense precautions. Wear a mask if place is crowded or it’s a place with likely sick people — all physicians offices, pharmacies etc… Try to keep my distance in public places. Generally go to restaurants at off hours — we do a lot of 3-4 pm meals out at popular restaurants so we limit exposure. Right now I’m concerned a bit because I keep seeing articles about how bad they think the flu/RSV/Covid seasons are going to be. Made sure I’m current on all vaccinations. Wash hands a lot and try not to touch my face when out. 

I guess I basically prioritize what is worth doing. I’m allowed to work from home so I do. I still do things with extended family and some friends — we might just choose less crowded public places. Have season tickets for my local NCAA gymnastics team and will just wear an N95 mask even if no one else does. I still do the things I really want to do, just try to be smart about how I do them.

Starting Hadlima - advice?,comment,"Hey, I was looking for some advice myself, then I stumbled upon your post.  I do have some experience with your concern.  Let me help put your mind at ease.  I want to start off by saying that the government and media have done an absolute bang up job at scaring the shit out of everyone.  

I have crohns colitis.  I have been on a biologic called Entyvio since 2016.  It is an immunosuppressant.  During that time, (I stopped taking it last month because I'm not on hadlima also) I never ever worried about getting sick or anything, why?  Because it wasn't something people talked about, like they do now with covid (But why not?  The common flu can be just as deadly).  And personally I still don't think its a big deal because I got covid in August 2022.  While on my Entyvio infusion AND while actively being on prednisone, which is a nasty steroid.  So I contracted covid, I woke up at 2am on Sunday with a fever feeling like crap, head ache body aches.  But by Tuesday morning when I woke up, I was basically back at 90 percent.  I honestly felt great.  I managed to get rid of covid pretty fast with medium strength symptoms.  

I know you're not looking for medical advice but hear me out...  Just possibly some vitamins that will help your immune system, which in turn can help put your mind at ease, knowing that your body may be better at fighting off infections.

There are some vitamins you can take that will help with your body immune function.  I was taking them inconsistently back when I got covid.  Vitamin D and zinc.  Those two are suppose to be really good for helping fighting off viruses.  I also take selenium, which is suppose to help protect against cell damage and infection.  Vitamin Quercetin, suppose to help protect against heart disease and cancer.  It can also have an anti-inflammatory and anti-histamine effect.  N-Acetyl Cysteine, it has many functions, but I take it for the immune boosting. This one, I'm reading that it should be taken for at most 30 days. 

I don't know if these are actually doing anything or what, but they're all fairly cheap, so I'm giving it all a try to see what kind of benefits I can achieve.  

So maybe adding immune boosting vitamins to your regiment may be beneficial to your lifestyle, so you know you can go out there and have that extra added cushion of protection.  That being said, try not to think about that stuff too much, because it really will have an effect on your mental health which then will affect other stuff.  In my mind I know I can be at ease, just from everything I know.  I know the news lies like a mother fucker.  And I know that a lot of people I know got covid, and no one died from it or got severely sick.  And back when covid was ""everywhere"", no one I knew even had it, and people they knew didn't even have it, yet the news was saying its everywhere!!!  I was a little detective back then, when I stopped trusting the news and ""health experts"" back in spring 2020, I had heard enough BS.

So from my experience, I would tell you to go out there and live life and have fun, like you're suppose to be doing.  Don't let this stuff hold you back.  From everything the TV and ""health professionals"" said, I should be dead.  I didn't hold back when covid started either, I still was living life how I normally did.  I'm not sure if you know this, but they found that ""asymptomatic"" people are NOT contagious.  Honestly, I don't even think they had it in the first place.  So much BS from the gov and TV with covid.  The truth is out there, they're trying to censor it, but its there.  

Anyways, live life friend, and have fun.",1,jqt5r32,,1688592561

I’m 35f. I was diagnosed in the summer of 2022. I first was prescribed hydroxychloroquine. I take it 5 days a week. It’s ok. I was still getting flare ups though so now I’m still on that but also taking sulfasalazine as well, 7 days a week. I’ve been doing both for about 3 months now. 

I’m still getting flare ups but i guess they aren’t as severe as they were when i wasn’t on medication at all. I just get so annoyed, like are these meds doing anything or ? 

Just curious to hear what you’re on.

My Rheumatologist says our next plan is to wait 3 more months, see if there’s any more progress then if not try certolizumab. I do know that’s a lot more pricey and it’s injections which I’m not very happy about. 

Wondering if anyone has any experience with these?

Oh I was also prescribed meloxicam for the pain… but I’ve only used it once or twice and didn’t notice anything???

"Undiagnosed, but strong family history",post,"I’m writing this while on the brink of tears. I feel like no one is listening to me. 

I (22f) have been experiencing debilitating fatigue and joint aches for 7 months. My sister (24) has been diagnosed with RA and my other sister (26) has strong symptoms of lupus. I have family history of RA on my mom and dad’s sides. 

I have been to a Rheumatologist and was prescribed hydroxychloroquine for 3 months. It improved my symptoms a little but not as much as I needed. 

All my tests have come back negative. I went as far as to get an MRI of my wrist to look for evidence of inflammation and that was also normal. I feel like I’m going crazy. 

For context, my joint pain is all over my body and near-constant. It’s definitely worse if I’ve been sitting still. It is bad enough that I struggle to sleep at night. I’m no longer able to do cardio because of how weak I’ve become. I also get long migraines. 

My doctors feel that because all the tests are negative I should be fine.",3,16vhhtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16vhhtx/undiagnosed_but_strong_family_history/,1696007918

I have found this entire process so frustrating because of the ignorance of the doctors I’ve seen about it. It seems like a lot of doctors don’t have a basic understanding of how immune conditions work or how many different conditions exist and how hard it is to diagnose early on. I’ve found myself explaining things they should definitely know from working with other patients.

The reactions I’ve gotten from nurses and doctors have also been very damaging. The attitude has been that either I am exaggerating my symptoms and should stop bothering them about it, or I have something causing these symptoms and I should figure it out with someone else.",2,k2s6j39,,1696023732

Finally…Diagnosis and Treatment,post,"I finally have an official diagnosis: Seronegative RA. Classic presentation with swollen fingers and toes. More advanced than originally thought: have erosions in some joints, small changes that don't rise to erosions in most joints examined. I'm guessing some larger joints like knees, ankles, shoulders have cartilage thinning too. Should I have asked what stage of RA or disease activity level? 

I’ve been prescribed Prednisone, hydroxychloroquin and Cimzia ( I’m hoping to get pregnant soon). Anyone who is able to get through life with only hydroxychloroquin? My doctor wasn’t super hopeful it would do much for me. Need approval from insurance for Cimzia- how long did it take for you? Is there a chance it doesn’t go through? Anyone who went through pregnancy- what was your treatment plan? How long did the meds take to take effect for you? 

From your experience, were you able to stop medicines and go into remission once some erosions were visible? 

To be clear, I do not have issues with medicines- my family are all telling me about lifestyle and holistic changes I should make. They are worried about long term effects of meds, but I’m pretty sure I need meds to start getting better. I just want to know what to expect.

Ears ringing from Hydroxychloroquine?,post,"Hey! 
Did anyone experience ear ringing and/or muffled hearing while taking hydroxychloroquine? 
I just started taking it like 2-3 weeks ago and since a few days I‘m having these ear problems, especially in the left ear.
I already went to see a GP who transferred me to an ENT who then checked my ears.
He told me my ears are fine.
After that I checked the package information leaflet from the HCQ where I found the information that problems like this might occure while taking the medication.
I already called my rheumatologists office to ask the doctor if this is dangerous and if I should continue to take the meds. The nurse told me the doctor will call me back but I haven‘t heard from her yet.
Has anyone experienced similar symptoms and can tell me if this might be dangerous?

Ears ringing from Hydroxychloroquine?,comment,"I am not sure about muffled hearing that may or may not be more serious (I have no idea) than tinnitus (ringing). I know for tinnitus that is generally a temporary thing that will disappear or lessen ovrer time and will go away if you discontinue the medicine (so not permanent). Obviously if it does not disappear like let's say after 4-6 weeks, then you will need to decide if it is worth the side effect to continue the drug or if you are taking 400mg try to reduce the dose to see if it changes, etc.

Maybe look up plaquenil and altered hearing, reduced hearing, etc. Of course based on the ENT report you likely do not have reduced hearing. It is more your perception of hearing that has changed. In my case my hearing feels a bit reduced from HCQ but that is likely because my jaw hurts right now. If you have a flare or TMJ or anything else that affects your jaw, then that can also affect your hearing. Something to keep in mind. It might even be the perception of the ring which is a sound close to your ear and therefore sounds that are ""far away"" are deprioritized by your brain (aka muted or out of focus sounding). Basically the ring is drowning out other sounds.",2,jueul1t,,1690932476

If you need a little hope…,post,"I know I’ve commented on several posts where others have expressed the same frustrations. I’ve been experiencing inflammatory arthritis for over a year now. My first rheumatologist was super hesitant to treat me with anything other than hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine, both which my body rejected. The whole time I was throwing up every day and in and out of the ER trying to take these meds my rheumatologist was not very responsive or helpful. He wouldn’t give me nausea meds nor any stronger nsaids to help with pain. He then told me to to stop meds and wait four months to see him again and if I got worse we would look at starting something else. I couldn’t wait another four months in pain so I found a second rheumatologist who listened to me and put me on methotrexate right away and even prescribed meloxicam for bad pain days. I went from basically bed ridden to baseline normal in two days. I’ve had 5 good days in a row this week and it’s only week one. It’s may take a while to find the right med but when you find yours - it’s magic. Also, if you feel stuck with your rheumatologist don’t be afraid to get a second opinion. I waited far to long to do so and I hurt myself by doing that. I wanted to share some good news and give some hope to those still searching for the magic combination.

If you need a little hope…,comment,"RA is an autoimmune disease. It is triggered by your immune system reacting to foreign substances which cause you to make autoantibodies which attack your own tissues.
The responsible immune system involved is that of your gut tissue.

Some people find that by keeping a careful log of everything they eat, drink, etc. each day and noting flare ups, good days, bad days, etc. you can often work out what that substance was. A journal is also useful to track meds and symptoms.

If you Google, you will find that many people have found grains to be such an antigen, e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, etc. I am one of those.

A big clue that food is involved is that your RA symptoms always improve when you fast (e.g. you are ill and can't eat much). Another is that your  symptoms change when on holiday and your diet has changed.


So 1. Keep a diary, 2. Try a grain free diet for 1 month.

With RA, everyone seems to be different. Some people have shown fantastic improvement by avoiding certain foods, some improve on a certain med while to others that med makes them even worse.

Only you know what affects you. Your doctor can only advise but it is you who are going through the pain and suffering. You need to research what an autoimmune disease is, log your details and work out what substances may be affecting you.

As an example celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that can be successfully treated by simply avoiding certain glutens. Most celiacs are sensitive to one particular gluten e.g. wheat gluten, rye gluten or barley gluten. But it has been found that about 20% react to a different substance (e.g. the gluten in oats). For those 20%, they have to work out what that substance is.

RA, celiac disease and other autoimmune diseases are all closely related, often symptoms overlap and doctors find it hard to distinguish between them because the spectrum of symptoms are so wide.
 
With my RA, if I avoid all grains then my symptoms improve dramatically but if I eat some gluten-free breads, I get a bad flare up the next morning. So I seem to be sensitive to something else in some breads , not just wheat.

I can eat rice (which is a grain and so does contain rice gluten) with no problems. I have not tested myself on other specific grains apart from wheat ( I made my own bread using only wheat flour with very bad results which was actually how I discovered all this stuff about grains and RA and that it was a 'thing'!).",2,ja22zdx,,1677394646

RA Pain,comment,"I’m sorry about the pain! It’s so terrible, I’ve done all the above that you’ve mentioned but nothing really ever takes away the pain. Diagnosed with RA and AS June 2021. Occupational and physical therapy can help. And lots of stretching. I’ve used THC oil on my joints that are hurting me. And something I’m recently trying (2weeks in) is using this plant (which is everywhere in the PNW) stinging nettle to rub all over the joints. It’s little needles puncture your skin and help promote the release of serotonin and acetylcholine and histamines which can help with pain and sleep. I get sleepy afterwards usually. Sometimes I get a little rash from the plant but hydrocortisone helps it. Again doesn’t remove the pain but takes edge off and let’s me sleep a little. Since you have allergies, I would test it out on small patch of skin to make sure or run it by your doctor. Hope it helps, sending you lots of relief energy 💜",2,ivd4sju,,1667786898
RA Pain,comment,I was in sever pain ive has RA for going on 9 yrs. My rhumatologist ended up diagnosing me with fibromyalgia a few years ago. It's a side effect from being in pain all the time.

Vaso-vagal episode starting hydroxychloroquine,post,"Hi guys,

My rheumatologist recently put me on hydroxychloroquine, as I've just been taking oral methotrexate 20mg since I was diagnosed earlier this year. I took one tablet of hydroxychloroquine before bed on Friday night. The following day as I was having my hair done I had a vaso-vagal episode for the first time ever while at the hairdressers. Went to the hospital and they confirmed it wasn't a seizure. The only thing they thought could have possibly caused it is the hydroxychloroquine as nothing else was out of the ordinary for me. However, this isn't a listed side effect. 

Just wondering if anyone else has had anything similar happen on this medicine?

Does hydroxychloroquine change your ANA?,post,"I’m confused about my pattern of blood results…

May: Negative ANA, positive autoantibody (SCL-70) done at urgent care 

Went to see a rheum and got the following results.

June: Positive ANA 1:80, positive SCL-70 

July: Positive ANA 1:160, positive SCL-70 

Went back to urgent care in September: Negative ANA

Does ANA fluctuate like this? I started taking hydroxychloroquine in mid-July. Would that bring the ANA down to negative? I also have not been diagnosed yet, so I don’t know if this would make it harder to get a diagnosis if the medication decreases symptoms and changes the lab results?

Methotrexate side effects advice please?,post,"UK, NHS treatment here.

This post isn't about knocking Methotrexate and I don't want to hear anyone's horror stories please. I would however like some sensible feedback regarding possible side effects please. 

Been taking 10mg Folic acid and MTX 15mg pills the following day, for 6 weeks now. 

At my most recent rheumatology appt they said my inflammatory markers had come down which is good news. 

When I described the side effects I was struggling with however, they dismissed them as all in my mind and absolutely not caused by MTX.  
They even said that the headache the day after taking the tablets only happens for the first two weeks, which is not my experience at all.

I'm getting continuous low mood / depression, brain-fog, tired aching muscles in my legs and acid stomach with bloating and wind. (Also alterations in food taste, but that's something I can work around.)

I'm also getting severe tinnitus and a bad headache plus migraines, all of which last around 3-4 days, after each dose. They literally said all this was caused by 'anxiety' and couldn't be caused by MTX.

They offered me Leflunomide as an alternative, but said it had the same gastric side effects, and also Amitriptyline for the migraines / depression, but I declined both as the Leflunomide sounded just as bad and being an older person I don't want to add Amitriptyline to the burden of drugs my body's already dealing with.

I just feel so demoralised; are they correct that MTX couldn't cause these issues and I'm imagining it all?

Edit: I just wanted to thank everybody for all your responses - you've been really helpful and have given me lots of really good suggestions to think about.

Methotrexate side effects advice please?,comment,"I had a lot of the same side effects you're describing. The way my rheumy explained it to me is mtx is metabolized in the liver and the whole dose is processed over the course of two or three hours. Which is why you get those uncomfortable borderline hangover symptoms the next day.

I had horrific headaches the two days after a dose and the only way to get rid of them was folic acid. I also have chronic migraines but they're very different from the mtx headaches. Since folic acid inhibits mtx it's generally recommended to not take it the same day as your mtx dose so I skipped folic acid that day and doubled up for the day after. I was on 5mg daily so in essence I took 10mg the morning after my mtx. I think the max daily dose is 20mg but regardless make sure you're drinking enough water to properly metabolize it. 

There's not much to do about the mood but low dose amitriptylene does wonders. Amitriptylene can have some serious side effects but they're less risky on low dosages. I've been on it for years and it's helped my mood, pain, and sleep a lot.

Mtx is also pretty rough on the stomach. I know the mere thought of food and water is unpleasant the day after a dose but you need to eat. It truly helps. I lived on dry toast and black coffee although anything with ginger or mint in it also helped. If the gastrointestinal side effects are too much bring up injections with your doctor. 

There's a reason why people take doses on Fridays and then disappear for the weekend. Because the side effects can suck. Take it easy while you adjust. It can take a few months to really figure it out.",5,k0jyjos,,1694701254

Question about your Rheumatologist's Rx tendencies,post,"I've (51M) been diagnoses seronegative RA for about 6 years and have been on Leflunomide for the entirety of that time, with Prednisone for occasional flares. As I told my (new, NP) Rheum., my pain has been getting gradually worse over the past 2 years. However, I never show inflammation in my labs, and I never have any swelling. I'm told they won't upgrade me to a biologic until I have swelling. They offered me Meloxicam and Voltarin. Has anyone experience this? Should I just search out a new RH? I could drive to a city \~1hr away and have more options. Has anyone gotten biologics due to pain, but without swelling?

Question about your Rheumatologist's Rx tendencies,comment,"it doesn't hurt to get another opinion. if your pain is worsening and isnt controlled with your meds and prednisone, then a med change might be what you need. meloxicam and voltaren may address pain, but if the issue is that your disease is undertreated then those aren't the solution. long-term use of NSAIDs can have plenty of risks, especially when you're doubling up (as both voltaren and meloxicam are NSAIDs, which is why some docs will tell you not to use them together).",2,iz83kxn,,1670385564

Sick but not SICK?,post,"So, I've been on weekly Humira for a couple years at this point, and my Rheuma recently added in daily Leflunomide. I know immuno-suppressive drugs put us at risk for catching things more frequently/easily, but is it common for us to feel like we're GETTING sick but not actually get the full-blown illness? 

The past couple days, my throat has been scratchy, my nose has been a little more stuffy at night/in the morning, and my fatigue level has been even worse than usual... but it feels like whatever it is is just kind of hanging out, not getting better, not getting worse. Not running the typical ""cold virus"" course. This has happened a few other times over the last maybe 6 months or so, where it felt like I was getting sick but then my body was like ""nope, just kidding.""

Right now, it's extra frustrating because a few people at my job have recently gotten COVID and, though this doesn't feel like the COVID I've gotten twice already, I know that doesn't necessarily mean it isn't. I'm going to get a test if I'm still feeling crummy tomorrow, but I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there's anything I could do to ease my mind about it.

No Medications are Working,post,"Hi! I’m a 35 yr old female and I have seronegative RA. I got it over night in November 2021, and it has been severe the whole time. 

I have tried Plaquenil (caused long QT syndrome), sulfasalazine (worked a tiny bit and then stopped - I’m still taking this at max dose), methotrexate (triggers an insane amount of hair loss and severe depression/suicidal thoughts), tried leflunomide (also caused hair loss and didn’t help at all), then I tried Humira (didn’t work), next was Rinvoq, which worked well until I had to stop taking it for 3 weeks for a major surgery, and now it’s not working at all after 3 months of being back on it.

I also take max dose of meloxicam twice daily, and cannot take corticosteroids due to causing severe depression and suicidal ideation almost immediately.

My doctors say my next try is Xeljanz, which is fine with me to try, but I feel like I’m running out of options. I’ve been at this for a year and a half and am going insane from the pain and lack of ability to use my hands.

I’m going nuts,comment,"Holy cow you've been through it. I'm NOT judging you, but please don't take meds that aren't prescribed because that can really f-up your diagnostic process. Plus, taking then stopping a biologic can make your body reject that biologic if it's prescribed to you. Please tell your rheumy about taking your grandma's Humira. For me, the absolute worst time with RA was where you are right now. In any situation, finding a diagnosis and then the treatment for it is stressful because every person is different. But many women have their first RA symptoms/flare during pregnancy or postpartum, while others feel their RA symptoms go down. Here's a [mayo clinic ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rheumatoid-arthritis/in-depth/rheumatoid-arthritis-pregnancy/art-20094103). But the most important thing is that pregnancy can really effect autoimmune diseases. So you're not alone, and this is not permanent! Please reach out to your rheumy ASAP because they will be able to help you get through this. Take care of yourself! Keep us posted 💜",6,jz9ku8g,,1693936874

I’m going nuts,comment,There are many RA meds you can try. Ask your rheumatologist about trying some others than the ones you mentioned. It can take a while to find the ones that work best for you. I get pain in the area you mentioned from my fibromyalgia but I also have a condition called anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome that causes a lot of pain around that area. It’s not a well known condition so often doctors don’t know to look for it. You might read up about it. Hope you find some relief asap! https://www.acnesawareness.org/symptoms,2,k0xhlk4,,1694920658

just tired,post,"total vent post lol. almost too tired to type this out. I just feel like it keeps getting worse. I'm at the point now where I can't even make it past 6pm without being so tired I'm dizzy. I almost had to pull over the other day while driving home. so much of my free time is spent sleeping. I just want to live a normal life. 

I'm not on meds right now because I'm worried about my current meds. I mentioned GI side effects with MTX. I know some of y'all have mentioned being switched to injections if you had GI side effects but that wasn't even offered to me. I didn't ask because I'm just so fucking tired of having to advocate for myself. I was prescribed sulfasalazine but I haven't taken it because I've read you can have GI side effects with that too. I'm currently seeing an allergist to see if there's a way I can take Enbrel again (it was really helping me but I started getting these huge injection-site welts). 

my last rheum appt he said that if I didn't do well on the sulfasalazine that insurance would probably approve the Enbrel. but insurance approval was never the problem? this is my 5th rheumatologist. my first appt with him he knew my history before I even walked in the door. apparently the third one I saw was in an affiliated hospital with the same EMR so he saw her note. even though she pretty much told me I was crazy he said he def thought I had seronegative RA and started talking about all the treatment options I hadn't tried and just really seemed to know his shit. my second appt with him it's like he didn't know anything about my history. he offered me leflunomide (that I'd already taken years ago and felt worse). and then mentioned insurance and Enbrel, seeming to forget about the injection-site reactions I had. and didn't seem concerned about the GI side effects of MTX at all; he said I could keep taking it if I wanted.

I'm just really tired. I want off this ride lol. and the only way to get better is to keep fighting and I don't have the energy left in me to fight anymore. not really sure why I'm posting this, just needed to get it out there and I know y'all will get it",12,10oqw33,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/10oqw33/just_tired/,1675047697

just tired,comment,"I was on Enbrel for awhile, and what I did to minimize the welts: take it out of the fridge about 1 hour before injecting to let it warm up, and take a Benadryl antihistamine, then ice the injection area before and after the injection. I went off Enbrel after a year because it stopped working for me and switched to Humira, a very similar drug to Enbrel - and no welts or pain with injection! Could you go onto Humira instead of Enbrel? Sorry you are feeling so awful, if you can find the right medication that works for you, you will probably feel a lot less fatigued.

It’s exhausting to go from doctor to doctor and feel like you’re not getting anywhere. So, in that you are not at all alone. 

How many injections did you do after you started getting the welts with Enbrel?  I had that happen too, and they eventually improved greatly. I did the same as another responder suggest and took Benedryl. I still sometimes have small reactions but it is not nearly as bad as it was.

Improvement of my symptoms,post,"Hi, I have a Rhupus, that it's both the existence of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. I was diagnosed with arthritis when I was 18 years old, I suspected that something was not right because for almost a month I had bilateral joint pain in my hands. In the beginning of my diagnosis the pain was tolerable and I could do a lot of things, but my mom decided to visit some family and I got the flu from one of my little cousins. It was really bad, because of the inmune reaction, my knees got all swollen together with the joints of my upper limbs, my mom had to help me to change clothes because it hurted a lot to move on my own. Since then the pain and the inflammation never leave me. For two years I was only taking:

Oral corticosteroids.

Methotrexate.

Hydroxychloroquine.

But recently I visited a new doctor and he added Arava (leflunomide) to my list of medications and FINALLY I have feel improvement with my symptoms, for a full month I have not feel pain, which it says a lot since it accompanied me for two years constantly. Also my gynecologist prescribed me birth control because apparently my lupus is very dependent on my hormones and I can say that the constant tiredness I felt for all this months had dropped significantly.",10,148g9ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/148g9ss/improvement_of_my_symptoms/,1686665229

"Starting Arava (Leflunomide). Taking it by itself, is that normal?",post,"A lot of the post I’m seeing mention taking Arava in conjunction with something else (often Humira or MTX). Is it normal that my Rheum proscribed this on its own? I was only just diagnosed and this is the first medication he wants to try. 

I’m 26 and have already had joint replacement surgery. I’ve also got pretty severe pain in my hands with some swelling and redness that is at its worst in the morning. I’m just really unsure about what is normal and what I can expect.",1,107w8ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/107w8ax/starting_arava_leflunomide_taking_it_by_itself_is/,1673313111
"Starting Arava (Leflunomide). Taking it by itself, is that normal?",comment,"There's no one silver bullet for the condition so it may mean trying a few things out to see what works for you. In my experience they'll say 12 weeks for something new (and then maybe give it longer if there's no immediate result. )  
I had about 8 months of guessing until I progressed to a biologic.   
Prednisone to try to control the symptoms while we tried out methotrexate, then added hydroxychloroquine and then leflunomide.  
Once there was demonstrated benefit from the adalimumab we were able to drop the prednisone, then the leflunomide, and most recently, reduce the methotrexate dosage with a view to discontinuing that too.   
The prednisone came with the most danger so I was under constant pressure from my rheumy to stop taking that, and then the leflunomide had the most likelihood of side effects so we were both happy to see the back of it. (I keep some prednisone on hand if I've had, or am planning on having, a really big day. )  
I'd say they want you to stay away from methotrexate (which is the most common treatment) because of your age because it ""is not recommended in pregnancy or while trying for a baby. This medicine can stay in a woman's body for 6 months after they stop taking it. For men, there is a risk that methotrexate can damage sperm. This can affect the way a baby develops during pregnancy."" (NHS). (Constantly hear of doctors assuming potential pregnancy despite patient protestations 'just to be safe'.)  
Definitely ask what their thinking is for peace of mind.   
For the record, I woke up to go for a wizz the first night after taking the biologic and found I could walk pain-free for the first time in 9 months. Not a dream: just hit the right drug finally.   
I'd also recommend hitting up old posts (maybe searching for leflunomide as long as you don't get worked up about tiny chances of side effects) to see other newbies war stories as well as all the healthy lifestyle stuff (and placebos) that can help you cope.   
For my hands (and wrists) I did heat and cold in the mornings (hot shower, ice in the sink full of water, strap-on ice packs, pressure gloves. )  
Unfortunately there's no normal but there's lots of resources here and plenty of support and hope.   
All the best.",3,j3pw0ie,,1673331894

Enbrel - infections & HPV ?,post,"So, I finally was given the go for Enbrel after trying a few other mild meds. I am currently taking 10mg of Arava (leflunomide) daily. The issue with trying a biologic has been my cancer history.  I am 5 years post cervical cancer caused by HPV and 1 year post lobectomy for lung cancer, not related to the first cancer.  My RA is pretty bad- I can't walk very well and sometimes not at all. My hands are trash along with elbows that no longer straighten out.  My knees look like I have balloons in them. Ugh. 

So, I really want to try the Enbrel. However, my rheumatologist isn't super good at explaining things or, honestly, taking me seriously it seems.  I have a very real mental issue with meds that I'm in therapy for, she is aware.  so, I think she sometimes just tells me things to make me think its all ok. IE: When I asked about Arava and if one would possibly need the 'clean out' med if it didn't work well or there were bad side effects, her reply, verbatim was, Nope its in and out. You don't have to take anything.  So,  that's probably true as well but she could have elaborated a bit on it, imho.  Overall, she is a good doctor, I get that she is trying to help me and believe she does care. still hard to talk to her about this as she simply says its not an issue or don't worry until we need to.  I need to be informed, not coddled. 

I am 55 years old. Have diabetes, and as mentioned, a history of two cancers and somehow I have some crazy toe nail fungus type thing that isn't bad, but its there since 5 years & nothing has worked to clear it. 

I am fearful that if I start this med, all of that will get worse, I do have very bad anxiety - therapy helps this so I can mostly be ok but when it comes to meds, No matter what it is I freak out. Let me tell you, Chemo was insanely hard for me.  I am even worried about my new puppy and the way she scratches my arms up so bad! 

Should I be this worried?  Does anyone have a history of HPV and still you take Enbrel? how do you deal with cuts, nail fungus or anything like that?  

\*\* my med fears stem from being drugged when I was much younger. 

It's taken all of my bravery to post this, please be gentle.  I do appreciate any replies! ",5,16onqo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16onqo5/enbrel_infections_hpv/,1695321903
Enbrel - infections & HPV ?,comment,"I'm sorry you're going through this. It's a really tough disease even when everything else is fine with your health.

I don't have the aversion to medication to the degree that you do, and I still had to really think about it when I was put on hydroxychloroquine. It worked fine for a bit but then my ra suddenly turned severe and aggressive. I went from having some relief to unable to do much of anything except shuffle when I wanted to walk and unable to hold on to most things, even a pen. I would have to use my other hand to pick up the pen and then place it in my right hand.

I was put on Orcenia infusions 3 months ago and within a week of the first infusion, I started to feel better. It's now been 3 months and I feel so much better with very little pain and more flexibility.

All of this is to say that sometimes you can't know before you go. I was told that I will have a greater chance of infections so I increased my supplements such as vitamin c, to do everything I can to help my immune system since the infusions are aggressively affecting the cells that are attacking the joints.

No one here can or should give you any type of medical advice but what we can do is tell you what we have experienced. I'm very happy with the results and I take it one day at a time. I also heard that treatment can work for a while and then not, so there's no way to know.",2,k1m9deh,,1695329037

Enbrel - infections & HPV ?,comment,"Hello my KY neighbor from your Knoxville neighbor. 🙂

Goodness, you have certainly had more than your share of physical difficulty! I am so very sorry that you've had so much to deal with. I can only begin to imagine what a struggle you've faced, but you truly are a survivor who is courageous and who just keeps on plugging along. If you were without tenacity, you'd have thrown in the towel long ago. 

Before going further, I must confess I'm not a doctor either. The info below is provided only to hopefully help ease your mind as you decide whether to go ahead with Enbrel. 

I saw your post last night and started looking for research on taking TNF inhibitors like Enbrel for people with a history of cancer. I found more than I expected, and what I read was that taking a drug like Enbrel doesn't appear to increase the risk of recurrent cancer compared to non-biologic DMARDS. One of the most comprehensive studies I read was a meta-analysis (a summary of other studies) on PubMed. The link and conclusion follow:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5776073/[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5776073/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5776073/)

CONCLUSION:

""In conclusion, this meta-analysis including 10 study populations and over 3,500 patients with a history of anti-TNF use after cancer diagnosis demonstrates the safety of anti-TNF therapy among individuals with a history of cancer, without a demonstrated risk for the development of new or recurrent cancer compared to non-biologic disease modifying therapies.""


A couple of items I read in several studies:

1. Using a TNF inhibitor for one with a history of cancer should be done in consultation with the patient's oncologist. 

2. Evaluating the possibility of recurrent cancer when considering use of a TNF inhibitor should be weighed against the severity of arthritis symptoms. 

So, IOW, would probably be a good idea to check with your oncologist and to keep in mind how tough a time you're having right now with your RA. Also, I'm guessing your rheumatologist is probably aware of your diabetes and fungus problem. 

I know it is must be very frightening for you to think that taking Enbrel could possibly cause your cancer to return even though that seems very unlikely. Despite your worry, you seem more than ready to plunge ahead. That's how I know you have courage, because courage is simply moving forward in the face of fear. 😊❤️",2,k1rs8pw,,1695418446

Running out of options …,post,"Hi everyone-

I was diagnosed with RA about a year and a half ago. I originally started on oral meds to control it, but my CRP was 46 and wasn’t going down- flare ups continued as well. I then moved to methotrexate IM injections because I am not very tolerant on orals. Lots of GI issues with oral meds and less with the infused meds. 

Currently I am on humira and leflunomide and I officially have left remission. My flare ups have returned and they are pretty intense. 

I was wondering if any of you have been put on the infusions? Remicade, Symponi etc. curious to see how people are doing on that treatment. 

If I do go on an infusion drug, my next problem would be that I have poor vein accessibility. 

I read about it in publications that some people have ports where they can get their infusions and blood draws that way. Do any of you have that? If so, how did you advocate for it?",3,10rc7i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/10rc7i7/running_out_of_options/,1675300005

I was on sulfusalazine (didn’t tolerate it at all), then MTX (first pills then injections), then we added Celebrex (it didn’t do anything for me so we stopped that). Then I got some mystery fever that lasted for like a month so I stopped all treatment. Then I started prednisone to help manage the huge flare up I was in for not being on any meds for 3 months. Then I tried Xeljanz (the pills) which didn’t do anything for me. Then Orencia which also didn’t work. Currently I am on low dose prednisone (planning to stop taking it completely in the summer when I feel better) and Actemra.

My story- any advice?,post,"
Hi everyone! I’m not sure what I’m really asking for… maybe just support. I’m having one of those nights where I can’t sleep due to pain so I’m just awake and anxious. I wanted to see if maybe anyone has any advice about things I’m going through. 

I (29F) was diagnosed with seronegative RA late 2022. I had started having a lot of pain in my hands in August 2022 but I’d already had a lot of chronic pain for years. The rheumatologist had me take prednisone for a few months, which I definitely don’t want to be on long term. It did help somewhat but the higher doses that helped the pain also gave me panic attacks. So far I’ve tried Sulfasalazine (gave me headaches) and methotrexate tablets & injectable (gave me stomach problems). Now I’m on leflunomide (no side effects yet but my pain is also worse than ever). I’m still taking the folic acid for 8 weeks after stopping the MTX. I’m also on diclofenac and cymbalta. 

I’ve been so stressed about work. I work part time and am getting a masters degree. A lot of things in my life seem to have taken a backseat because it takes all the energy I have just to focus on school and work. I was told by HR that I don’t qualify for any FMLA because I’m part time. They recommended I try to get disability. So I got that approved and I know my doctor asked them to let me call out up to 4 days a month, but HR only approved 1 day a month. There are some months where this is fine, but usually I’m calling out 3-4 days. Luckily my boss is very understanding (we work in healthcare) and he said he doesn’t really care how much I call in as long as I keep communicating with him. He said the most HR can do is tell him “hey she’s called out too much” but it’s up to him if I get fired and he won’t do that. I do trust him but as you can imagine I’m still relatively uneasy knowing that my disability only covers 1 day and my job basically is relying on his word. I was told there was a medical disability I could take for up to 12 weeks but it’s not job protected. It’s also unpaid which would be really hard for me because I’m already living paycheck to paycheck. Within the next year my department will also be moved so we’ll have new management. I’m very worried and assuming that my new boss won’t be as accommodating as my current one. On top of that, I have to wait until May 2024 to get a surgery that I really need. My insurance wouldn’t cover it until I’ve been at my current workplace for 3 years. So my health also hinges on me being able to keep my job until then.

Otherwise, I just feel like I’ve been so depressed and in pain 24/7 for about a year now. None of the medication has worked well and I feel so alone. My boyfriend is really supportive but I know there’s no way he can really understand. Especially on the days I feel like I can’t work, I get so irritated with him when he asks me if I can tough it out. I feel like I’ve been doing that for a year and I’m exhausted. I can’t imagine going on like this much longer. My hands are always in so much pain. Trying to simply write something down feels like when you’re lifting weights and you’re just like “come on just push one more time.” All my muscles ache. I’m constantly hot, like dripping sweat all the time and having 3 fans on me at home when it’s 65*F. My legs are always aching and it often wakes me up at night. Every time I tell my rheumatologist how miserable I am I feel like I’m brushed off. I’m always told to just “wait a little longer” but nothing changes and I’m not sure what I’m waiting for. I’m trying to find a new rheumatologist but a lot of them where I live aren’t accepting new patients. I think I’m just having a hard time adjusting to my new level of physicality. I used to be someone so motivated and would get so much done in a day. Now I study for a few minutes and look around at how messy I’ve let my home get because I can’t stand up long enough to clean it. It’s been making me feel extremely bad about myself and it sort of just feels like I’m in this little bubble of pain that separates me from everyone else. 
Anyway, that’s about it. I’m so sorry this was so long. I just wanted to tell my story. Thanks for reading.",11,16e4x3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/16e4x3r/my_story_any_advice/,1694263681
My story- any advice?,comment,"My opinion, so take it as an opinion. You have too much going on to focus on your wellness. I think you need to take a pause on grad school. Can you finish the semester and take a break or is it early enough for you to take a break now? You can work with the department/advisor and the disability resource center. 

Next, do some research into finding a new drug. Go to your rheumatologist and tell them you have a plan you would like to try. The biologics are a great option. The drug companies have funds to help you afford it. Get on prednisone right now so you can have enough pain relief to get on the new drug. You can ween yourself off in the future. Ask for an anti inflammatory prescription like naproxen. You have to advocate for yourself. Don’t take the status quo from your doctor. Tylenol pm can help with sleep. 

Tell your boyfriend what you need from him. He doesn’t know. My husband gives me my injections of Cimzia because I have a hard time with needles. I ask for help opening containers or lifting things. I also need hugs and I ask for them. 

Rest and sleep when you need it. 
Find an outlet for depression and anxiety. For example, I started a night time routine. It’s weird but helps. I floss, wash my face, put on moisturizer, and brush my teeth. I tidy up the kitchen. Then I get in bed and journal. I have a journal with prompts to answer. I put lotion on my hands and feet. I feel like a old fashion woman from the 1960s. The routine has provided calm for me. I make sure to take some deep breaths. Maybe you can find something that works for you. 

You are in a tough spot right now. Be kind to yourself. Advocate for yourself. Take control as much as you can. It will get better. I have faith in you!

Message me if you want. I’ve been in your spot and know how tough it is.",10,jzuvoax,,1694288851
My story- any advice?,comment,"Sounds like you're really having a hell of a time. I'm so sorry. Could you possibly try a biologic? If copays are a problem, most of the biologic companies have $ assistance for people with private insurance.

With all you're doing with school and work both, that would probably be tough for someone without arthritis. For you, though, with the extra load you have to carry, it's even tougher. I think it's somewhat miraculous that you're able to do all you are with the pain you have. I remember years ago when I was in grad school, and a prof told me just that - what I was doing was miraculous. Made me feel kind of proud. The work and stress really took a toll on me though. Is there any way you might be able to carry a lighter load with your grad program?

You are not alone with this. I live with pain whenever I'm conscious and especially when I move around because I've had JRA so long. Lots of people are here to help you through this. 

Hang in there. Things are bound to get easier for you in time. ❤️💕

My story- any advice?,comment,"The spoon theory is very useful to adapt to chronic illnesses: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory

First, get on a biologic. Advocate for yourself that the existing meds are not working for you. Find a new Rheumat if you have to. Pain is the main indicator of disease activity and not blood markers. I’m Seronegative and my doctor is treating me based off my symptoms entirely. All biologic companies have discount programs that would cover your deductibles. Call your insurance and get approval for biologics like Humira. They are far better at slowing disease progression. Tell the doctor you are in a critical phase of your life with completing a master and working. You cannot do that with constant pain and you need treatment. 

Second, talk to your university. They should be able to give you a semester off for medical reasons which should give you enough time to find a treatment that works. If financial aid is an issue, you can try to seek exemption on medical grounds. Point is, talk to people at your grad school. You’ll likely find people are more helpful than you’d expect. 

Third, find a job that has better HR policies. Work from home as much as you can. I know the job market is tough right now, and finding a job is a stress in itself. But you have to find a way to reduce stress on yourself. Noone like living in a dirty messy house. But ask yourself, is it the most important thing in your life right now? Prioritising is the most important thing to you right now. Again, ask for help. 

You have a very painful life changing disease. You cannot get through this without making major changes and you are going to need to ask for help. As no one can know what you are going through. I’ve had to inform my work of my condition- I absolutely hate anyone knowing my personal business. I’ve had to ask my spouse to take over the house work as doing any housework brings on a lot of pain for me. My spouse didn’t understand how bad I was till I told him in detail how I feel- my joints feel like theyve been glued together. I’m in pain every second of everyday. If I try to tough it out and keep on going as normal, I’ll crash into bed and not be able to go to even the bathroom. Tell your BF to read about RA fatigue and pain, and develop some real empathy. It’s not regular arthritis that happens in one joint. All your joints are failing you. Repeat the message till it sinks in. Stop carrying on as normal. When you do that, it makes your bf believe you are alright. I tried and I got so much worse. I do what I absolutely have to now and I’m feeling much better. You’ll also feel more in control of your life and pain when you start making decisions prioritising your health. 

Chronic pain is a whole different beast. And RA is worse because it limits your mobility severely, yet you look completely normal. Depressions is common. Antidepressants might help, but what I’ve found has helped is being open about what I’m going through and seeking support and help. If your bf refuses to give it, I would be reevaluating the whole relationship honestly. Point him to the spoon theory. 

When you can’t do something, say I don’t have enough spoons! I’ve had to delay important things in life as I just cannot sustain much right now. I’m barely able to get through half a day of low activity. It’s okay to take steroids for shorter term: a few months is really alright. Years and years are damaging. Take NSAIDs. The inflammation will cause you more damage than any medicines can. This is a tough tough time but you will get better. You have to advocate for yourself with doctors, at work, at college and with your bf. No one will just help us because we are in pain! I hope you get better soon. You are so strong to be doing so much when you are in such pain. You can do this! Good luck!",4,jzwosdg,,1694315604
My story- any advice?,comment,"Hey, I really agree with the previous poster that for your well-being you're going to need to cut back some with all you're doing. Work and grad school together is a lot for a healthy person to handle. Experiencing constant pain while doing all that is IMO maybe asking too much of yourself. In no way does that mean you're somehow weak or less than. You just have an extra load to carry.

In my prior post, I mentioned how driving myself mercilessly in grad school while in intense pain and needing hip replacements took a real toll on me. I was determined to try to go at the same pace as everyone else and denied that I had a hell of an extra load to bear. I refused to admit to myself that I was ""different."" Well I ended up in a very severe major depressive episode, feeling panicked all the time, and trying to drink my pain away. I had to cut back or I might have ended up even worse off.

I don't know if any of this is at all helpful for you, but I'm hoping you might find something to relate to in my experience. Perhaps it's time to cut yourself some slack. I can't really say; only you can decide that. 💔",3,jzwdbe7,,1694310348

For example, I take methotrexate and enbrel and my rheumatologist told me to avoid alcohol the day I take my methotrexate. Just for reference I’m a 29 F and only have 1-2 alcoholic beverages a week if I have any alcohol.

I also have celiac disease so I avoid beer. In my opinion gluten free beer isn’t very good but there are many alternatives like ciders, seltzer, wine, or gluten free hard alcohols.",2,k12nhuk,,1695003727
alcohol consumption with arthritis + medications,comment,"I’ve found clear alcohols like gin (with tonic) are better than wine or whiskey. Wine has been the worse in terms of making the pain worse. But in general, keep alcohol to a minimum. It does increase inflammation in the body - binge drinking is probably a bad idea but a glass here or there is probably okay. Unless you are on Mtx or your doctor tells you otherwise. They should be monitoring your liver function. All the NSAIDs and meds do not go well with alcohol.",1,k13kys3,,1695024187
alcohol consumption with arthritis + medications,comment,"My body doesn't tolerate alcohol even if I wanted to drink. Alcohol can induce inflammation in the gut. Some patients with RA are more affected than others because RA can attack any organ. I have GI issues, so I go from 0-sick with no fun in between. With a family history of celiac, my guess is that you would be sensitive to the GI inflammation too. (Obligatory I am not a doctor)

The biggest risk with alcohol and RA is that alcohol and the medication to treat RA both are taxing on the liver. My doctor needs bloodwork often to watch my liver function. She always marvels at my numbers, but I know it is because I don't drink at all.",1,k15uohg,,1695062338
Worsening symptoms…permanent?,post,"
39f, diagnosed 8 years ago seronegative but only active symptoms in last 2-3 years. Was on Hydrochlorquine, methotrexate and now leflunomide. Hydrochlorquine and methotrexate did nothing. Leflunomide was a life saver. Been on it for a year now. 

Symptoms have begun worsening last few months. Was running last summer and now damaged cartilage in my knee. 

The brain fog and my hands are my worrisome part. I work full time on a computer and I’m struggling. I can barely concentrate. My memory is shot.

My hands are constantly aching. They feel better in a fist Vs stretched out. They are also trembling constantly. 

My next doctors appointment is September 5. If I go into biologics, will it relieve the stiffness? Or is the stiffness here to stay?

I type all day long, hence my concern",2,12rv6k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/12rv6k3/worsening_symptomspermanent/,1681914662
Worsening symptoms…permanent?,comment,"Unfortunately with RA a medication could work great for awhile, even years, then stop being effective. I have been through methotrexate,  hydroxychloroquin, Enbrel, Humira, and now take Rinvoq, in the last 10 years. It's a good thing we have so many options! You may want to contact your Rheumatologist to let them know you are having issues. They may be able to give you prednisone or a prescription strength anti-inflammatory to tide you over until you can see them.",2,jgz5x0w,,1681964976
Worsening symptoms…permanent?,comment,"The biologics reduce the response of your immune system, which reduces the inflammation.  Have you taken any prednisone?  It sounds like you are in a flare.  They may need to try to end the flare with steroids and then put you on the biologics.  As far as your knees, try asking an ortho doctor (or your rheumy) about Zilretta or Symvisc injections.  Zilretta is similar to a corticosteroid.  Symvisc is an injection that adds a cushion to your knees to prolong the knee to avoid replacement.  I had symvisc injections 4 times a year for 3 years before I had a reaction to it.  I went from not being able to climb stairs to climbing a 2 flight set of stairs 2 days after the injection.  Pain subsided too.",1,jgwst7n,,1681928206

Liver supplements,comment,"I don’t take that specific med but take methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine & humira. Even before I started them I took a daily Milk Thistle capsule for mine. My liver readings are always good. And I might drink a little alcohol every other weekend.",1,j7k7wzu,,1675770923
